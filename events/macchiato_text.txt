You recovered 1 HP!
Your HP was maxed out.
You grasped at nothing.
You drank the hot chocolate. It tasted wonderful. Your throat tightened...
You equipped the Pencil.
You re-applied the bandage.
You held out the flowers. A floral scent fills the air. Nothing happened.
You looked at the junk ball in admiration. Nothing happened.
You equipped the Halloween Pencil.
You equipped the Lucky Pencil.
You used the Egg.
You held the cards. They felt flimsy between your fingers.
what? a heart shaped box of chocolates?
oh, i get it.
heh.
wow.
you're really...
hm.
alright, alright.
... okay.
you wanna make a return on these, don't you?
okay, okay, no need to break my heart.
here's five dollars.
(You traded the chocolates for 5 dollars.)
(You could give Alphys the chocolate if you talk to her.)
Woah, Kris, where the hell'd you get that?
... someone gave it to you?
HAHAHA!! YEAH RIGHT!!! You stole it, didn't you!?
Well, c'mon!! Let's eat it and hide the evidence!!
(You and Susie shared the heart-shaped box of candies.)
(Both of you had a feeling in your chest...)
Ow, my stomach...
(... that you shouldn't have eaten all of it.)
(You unhesitatingly devoured the box of heart shaped candies.)
(Your guts are being destroyed.)
(You accept this destruction as part of life...)
You looked through the glass.
For some strange reason, for just a brief moment...
You thought you saw Susie glaring at you, coldly...
But when you moved the glass away,
You see her looking at you, smiling and making a rude gesture.
... but nothing happened.
It doesn't seem very useful.

(Ring, ring...)
Kris, honey, what is it?
What? No, I am not giving you a ride home.
Our house is not far. It is just at the top of town.
Try walking. It builds character, honey.

Kris, I am grading papers.
I can talk to you when you get back, alright?
Our house is only at the top of town, you know.

Oh, you are going to the library later?
Well, thank you for telling me this time! Have a nice time!

Kris, do not worry about the library.
Ah, Kris! You are going to do your project...?
Oh, are you calling to ask for my help!?
I will go find our homemade scented glue-sticks!
... Oh? You have a partner this time?
Kris!! That's wonderful!!
I hope they like butterscotch-scented gluesticks!
Kris, do not worry about going to the library.
If Berdly harasses you about our debt...
I will come and throw a smoke bomb so you can escape.
... maybe not. Hee hee hee. Try your best, honey.
Hi honey! How was your group project?
I can give you a ride home in a minute, I am just...
... oh? No need?
You are still spending time with a friend...?
Oh dear! Two days in a row, Kris! Is that a record?
Have fun, honey! Be back before sunset!

Calling me again? What must your friend think?
Have fun with your friend, honey!
Hello, Dreemurr residence.
What? You would like to talk to "Susie"?
...
Of course, here you are.
KRIS FINISH WASHING YOUR DAMN HANDS!!!
Kris, the phone is going.
Would you mind getting it for me while I...
...
Kris? Why are you calling our house?
(Everybody seems too busy to pick up the phone...)
Your eyesight became blurry.
Your heartbeat quickened.
"Hot Chocolate" - Topped with home-made marshmallows in the shape of bunnies.
"Pencil" - Weapon 1 AT Mightier than a sword? Maybe equal at best.
"Bandage" - Heals 10 HP It has cartoon characters on it.
"Bouquet" - A bouquet of beautiful flowers in many colors.
Perhaps it could be offered to someone.
"Ball of Junk" - A small ball of accumulated things in your pocket.
"Ball of Junk" - A small ball of accumulated things in your pocket.
It smells like scratch'n'sniff marshmallow stickers.
"Halloween Pencil" - Weapon 1 AT Orange with black bats on it.
"Lucky Pencil" - Weapon 1 AT Covered in green clovers and rainbows.
"Egg" - Not too important, not too unimportant.
"Cards" - The Jack of Spades, and the Rules Card.
"Box of Heart Candy" - It's not yours. Will that stop you?
There is a small shard of something in your pocket.
It feels like glass, but...
"Eraser" - Weapon 1 AT Pink, it bounces when thrown on the ground.
"Mechanical Pencil" - 1 AT It's tempting to click it repeatedly.
"Wristwatch" - Armor 1 DF Maybe an expensive antique. Stuck before half past noon.

Throw it away anyway?

Hand shaking, you dropped the ball of junk on the ground.
It broke into pieces.
You felt bitter.

Hey, Kris! What's up? Didja lose your pencil again?
Here, you want the candy-cane one or the one with lights on it?
Huh? You want to be partners?
Ummm... Sorry... Berdly already asked me...
But I could ask Ms. Alphys if we could make a group of 3!
I'll ask if you're sure!   Not yet     Yes. Ask. 
OK, I'll ask!
Miss Alphys! Umm, is it OK if we have a group of 3?
con
Yeah, I'm sure there's someone else you can ask!
Do you wanna be partners? Not yet     Yes 
Umm, OK. You just keep doing your thing, Kris.
Alright. Let's get this over with.
We'll get more chalk. Mosey back to class. And then, Kris...
YOU'LL do our project.
How's that sound?   Good        Bad

Welcome. I am the Prince of this Kingdom...
The KINGDOM OF DARKNESS.
Kris, Susie... There is a LEGEND in this land.
A LEGEND that one day, two HEROES of LIGHT will arrive,
And fulfill the ancient prophecy, foretold by time and space.
Please, Heroes... Listen to my tale...
  
We know itAlready
Very well then...
...
Umm, r-really? Are you sure? It's fairly important.
And... um, in my opinion, it's a really nice PROPHECY!
I think you'd quite like it!
Phew! Um, very well then...
... really? You've heard it already?
Oh... Perhaps I shouldn't have rehearsed it so much...
Look, dude, we didn't come here for a bedtime story.
Just tell us how to get home.
Ummm, the easiest way would be to seal the Eastern FOUNTAIN.
Fountain?
You mean, uh, like the water bubbler or something?
THE fountain. That which gives the DARK WORLD form.
... umm, are you sure you actually know the legend?
Look.
No.
But I think I've got enough info.
See you two later.
W-wait! Let me at least tell you how to...
I'll beYourSubject
KeepDreaming
This is the CASTLE TOWN, where my subjects reside...
Err, well, they would if I had any...
Oh, don't worry about me, Kris!
I'm certain I'll find a subject someday...
fe
H... Huh!?
Why, Kris, you don't have to do that...
... but, if you insist...
Kris, as your Prince and authority, I order you to...!
Please let me know what to do!
Oh, thank you, Kris! I will!
I know
Really!?
Er, Kris, you know you can hold [1] to run...?
Really? And yet you choose not to...?
Right, who knows how long these leisurely days will last...
There's nothing wrong with taking your time, Kris.
Right! You'll move faster by holding [1]!
And I'll be right behind you, so don't worry!
... Unless you want to get away, in which case, sorry.
Umm, Kris, did you know...
... You can skip text by pressing [1]?
... Really? So you've just been...
Listening to me talk, because you wanted to?
I'll try to make it worth your while, Kris!
Right! In the case you read very quickly.
Or you're tired of what's being said.
... No need to skip my text, right, Kris?
Don't
Oh, Kris! It's the training dummy I made!
Now seems like a great chance to prepare for the enemy.
Would you like me to teach you how to fight?
OK! Get ready, Kris!
Right, you already fought Lancer, didn't you...?
I was so excited to teach you, I absolutely blanked!
... B-but, um... Just in case you forgot anything...
Here! I made a Manual for you and Susie!
Press [1] to open the menu and use it in your ITEMS.
(You got the Manual.)
I canhandle it
.....
Oh my! The Great Door is opened?!
No wonder Lancer was able to come through...
...
Kris, once we pass through this door...
Our adventure will really begin.
A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy...
But, Kris, I believe YOUR choices are important, too.
This world is full of all kinds of people, Kris.
In the end, how we treat them makes all the difference.
So let's try our best to get by without FIGHTing.
If we can manage to do that...
I believe this tale may have a happy ending.
Otherwise, I fear that...
... you may not... find the result favorable.
... Oh, I'm sorry! Is that too much to ask?
Kris, I knew you were a hero the moment I saw you.
Let's try our best, alright?
O-oh, I'm sorry!
Kris, in the end, what you choose is up to you.
As long as you're happy with it, I'm happy too.
So just try your best, and don't worry!
(There are two objects hanging from the tree.)
(Take one?) 

(There's a candy hanging from the tree.)

Alright, everyone's put in their entries!
Blue person, you can choose.
Since you look like you don't care.
 
(You take the crumpled up piece of paper.)
(You open it up.)
OK!! And your name is...!
... Hmm.
I don't think I'm allowed to say this one.
It's PRONOUNCED, "The $!? Squad."
Woah, I'm not allowed to say Tier-TWO swear words!
Wow. You three's collective dad must be very cool.
Er, could we PERHAPS consider a DIFFERENT name?
Ralsei, you don't HAVE to be in our Squad.
Yeah! How about I be in the Squad and YOU be the bad guy?
Here. Call up my dad.
Tell him he has a new son.
One that has to take a shower every time he reads a swear word.

OK, fine! We can keep the name! I just won't say it.
Haha, me too!
See ya, losers! It's shower time!
(You take the paper with "LANCER" written on the outside.)
(On the inside...) (It also says "LANCER.")
Wow, who did that one? It's really good!
Wait, why do YOU get to choose the name?
Hey. He didn't, Kris did.
Yeah! It doesn't matter who MAY have written it!
Regardless, LANCER's going to meet absolute doom!
... this name feels weird, actually.
Hmmm....
I know! Let's call it the LANCER FAN CLUB for short!
See you later, me!
(You take the neatly folded piece of paper.)
"The Legendary Heroes: The Herald of Fun and Friendship"
Oh, oh! That's mine!
See, I think it's the perfect name...
Because we're all friends: That like to have a lot of fun.
Okay, first... jeez, that's a mouthful, dude.
Second, what are our enemies gonna think?
That we're gonna be BUDDIES with 'em?
Let's change it to something SHORT! INTIMIDATING!
Something PUNCHY! Something BAD-ASS!
... like what?
Well, uh... Y'know, for starters...
How about... JUST, uh...
"The Fun Gang."
Ya know, just, uh, concentrating on the "Fun" part.
It's perfect!!!
Well, see ya, Fun Gang!
I've got to osmose my afternoon milk!

Alright, Kris. Just gimme the straight shot.

Hey, Kris, you wanna chat or something?
Don't worry, there's no way you can bore me right now!
 
Hahaha, that's what I thought! She's a PEACH, huh...?
Fuzzy n' sweet on the outside, a total NUT on the inside!
Oh, your dad? Yeah, he's a real fruit himself too.
Which one? I dunno, probably a hairy one... like a kiwi.
Hahahaha!!!
Okay, okay, seriously, you wanna chat or something?
Really? You've grown up a lot, Kris.
I'm proud of you.
Wasn't too long ago you were just the creepy kid next door.
Now you're the creepy kid right in front of me!
Hahahaha!!!
Huh?
She's a sweetheart, isn't she, Kris?
Smart, kind, sweet... couldn't ask for a better daughter.
I just wish she wasn't so... defenseless.
Scary movies, bugs, Santa Claus... everything scares her.
And when it happens, she freezes like a deer in headlights.
Remember she used to even be afraid of humans under the bed?
(Kris, it was NOT nice of you to hide under there, by the way!)
... anyhow, that's what's tough about being in here, Kris.
Not what's going on with me.
Just that... in the meantime, I can't be there to protect her.
Keep an eye out for her, OK?
Kris, even if we've grown apart, we still love your family.
After all, me and Asgore were college pals, right?
Oh hey... now that Asriel's off to college...
Y'think he's doing any CRAZY parties, like me and your dad?
Heh, I'm just pulling your leg. Your dad was no party animal.
Your MOTHER on the other hand...! Whoo!
She'd alway fuss about going, but once the party started...
Yikes, man!
Once she hit me clear across the room with a key lime pie!
I got smashed into the snack table and toppled everything!
Tasty pie though. Couldn't complain.
... So, why am I in here...?
Well, they found some crap, so it's just some tests.
Yeah, it's no big deal. Nothing a Holiday can't handle.
I'll be outta here in a jiff, then I can go back to, I dunno...
Yelling at you for getting tangled in our light display.
Then what the hell're you here for, Kris!? To gawk!?
You thought this was the zoo or something!? C'mon!

(There's an anime review.) (Read it?)
Teen'z Corner Monthly Toon Review: Mew Mew Kissy Cutie 2
This reviewer had Mew Mew 2 as her first exposure to the series...
And let her tell you, it makes Mew Mew 1 look like a dumpster with sparkly cat ears!
With a darker storyline and more mature themes...
The second one treats the viewer like a real adult...
Instead of like an animal that will die if it goes ten seconds without seeing a beach ball.
Not to mention, Mew Mew's character in the first one...
Is more stale than the ramen I eat at home by myself with the lights off.
Teens and older should check out this dark masterpiece!

Oh my god... Can I talk to you about something?
Actually, like, anything, though. Your choice.
Lil Krissy! Did you wanna talk about something!?
Oh my god, Asriel! Like, what a cutie pie!
Do you remember when me and him went to the dance?
That was like... The best night EVER!
Even though I spilled the entire punch bowl all over him...
And danced inappropriately in front of your mom...
And got arrested in the parking lot for making a scene...
Hahaha! That was SO much fun! Tell him I said hi!
Like, that green girl next door?
Oh my god, Krissy. She's like... my LIFE VILLAIN.
Like, the other day, I went to see Cat Petters 2...
And the only other person in the theater was her!
Then I went to QC's and ordered a Catpuccino...
And she, like, was already drinking one!
She's SUCH a copycat! ... uhh, copygator?
Copysaurus? Copodile? IDK, she sucks!
Ooo, how's Catti doing? I have no idea.
We, like, totally can't connect at all!
Yesterday, I asked if she wanted to hear me play the ukelele...
She said no! And then she, like, told me...
My playing is "an anti-blessing from Planet Hell."
What the HECK, Krissy?
That's SOOO cute! I love my fricked-up lil sis!
Oh, you gotta go? Do you have, like, homework...?
You should, like, let me help!

Ugh, that chick next door drives me NUTS.
I keep seeing her EVERYWHERE I go. She's a TOTAL copycat.
Like, WHY though? Doesn't she realize she'll NEVER be me?
Honestly, her whole family is, like, SO trashy.
Once her sister served me a coffee and I swear it was half cat fur.
Like, get a hairnet, girl. For, like, your whole body.
Remember that time you wanted to hang out with us big kids?
I was like, "yeah, of course! Just get us some burgers!"
Then, like, amazingly... You ACTUALLY got them...
So I told you to go back and get some french fries, too...
... then a dozen miniature cakes...
They were SO good, I ate like six!
Then I like... Suddenly got so sick I had to go home.
Man.
So, like, anyway... Kris, are you busy?
Aww, that's no way to talk to your almost-sister-in-law.
Nah, I'm joking. But, like...
Remember that time I played truth or dare with Azzy?
I, like, made him give me his first kiss...
Then your mom found out he kissed someone, and...
Like, I think she basically dialed 911.
I swear your family went to church, like...
Every single day that week.
Aw, Krissy, you just wanted to say hi?
That's adorable... Now get out of here.

You're just like us. An' people like us gotta help each other out.
C'mon this way.

ONE!!! ONLY ONE DOLLAR!!! PLEASE!!! PLEASE!!! I NEED THIS RIGHT NOW!!!
R-really!? You changed your mind!?

 What's TP?
 Secret
Gaining TP
Bye
I'm TP Master. Ask me about TP's.
Later, kid.
TP? What's TP? That's what lets you cast SPELLS, see!?
When you see that orange bar, Cast some SPELLS when it's filled up far.
TP...! It's quite a caper! TP! Stands for... ... Toilet Paper!
... no, it stands for Tension Points.
What, really!?
TP only lasts, inside a fight. Once you win, it's out of sight.
Having extra, feels unbearable. No point in saving, it's straight-up terrible.
But leftover TP turns into extra money at the end of battle...
You mean I only should have been using one square!?
You get TP when you DEFEND. Protect yourself, then cast SPELLs, friend.
You also get TP by getting close to bullets.
Look for the heart outline when you get close to bullets.
You rhymed "bullets" with "bullets."
B-because it's important!
You rhymed "bullets" with "bullets"...?
 Pacify
 Healing
Fact
I'm Ralsei Master. Ask me about RALSEI's.
Ralsei's spell's called PACIFY. Use it on BABIES, before they CRY.
What? It safely removes a "TIRED" enemy from combat.
What if you're fighting a BABY!?
Ralsei has a spell that HEALS, dude.
Why use that, when you can eat FOOD?
Because you won't have to use up an ITEM?
I could have avoided all those empty calories!?
Ralsei loves when you give us MONEY.
He will hug you, and call you HONEY.
Hey, that's not true!
You don't need money to get me to do that!
 Warning
 Attack
I'm Susie Master. Ask me about SUSIE's.
When KRIS uses WARNING, SUSIE can't hit. So make sure to -
So there's no reason to use it.
Unless... Unless you wanted not to hurt -
SO THERE'S NO REASON.
Susie's gone, I'm afraid, I'm afreet.
*Seems like WARNING is obsolete.
The days of WARNing, have long since past.
The circumstances, changed pretty fast.
Susie always attacks, the foe on top.
She'll smash them, with a crushing chop.
She always strikes, at the first thing she sees...
Oh no, oh no! She's looking at ME!
Susie's gone, so no attack.
Will you two pick up the slack?
Susie's BUSTER, RUDE as may be...
Will deal more damage, if you just press [1]!
Susie loves, when you give us MONEY. She will -
Nope, don't care.
Did I say something funny!?
Susie's gone, so no facts.
Will you two pick up the slackts?
SUSIE seems to have changed, just a hair.
That kind of growth is actually rare.
 Reviving
 Acting
I'm Kris Master. Ask me about KRIS's.
When HP goes negative, your friends fall down
But bringing them back, is easy-town
Plain foods and spells, work like a charm -
And with a MINT, you can cure all HARM.
Even normal items and spells can revive people, huh?
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!
If you only ACT, you might start to think -
What about the guy with the scarf in pink?
If you know ACTing will make the enemy friendly -
Then you can ask me to SPARE on the SAME TURN.
Or, cast PACIFY if you know they'll get TIRED.
If you plan ahead, a lot can happen in ONE TURN!
Hey, who's the MASTER here, me or you!?
It's a good idea, to give us BUCKs.
It'll make you happy, and fill you with LUCKs.
Over there, is our DONATION HOLE.
We had a BOX, but it got STOLE.
 Throw $1

(If you like our tutorials, please throw your money into a hole.)
(The hole is filled to the brim with cash.)
(You put a dollar in the "Hole.")

(You failed to budget enough money to throw into a hole...)
(You decided to save the dollar for a different hole.)

And I didn't eat anything!
Sorry. What are you two having, exactly...?
Just a daily treasure I hid in this stump's orifice.
And that is...?
Feast for yourself, my main man.
Kris, do you want to, um, try it?
Oh, there's a... Honeypot? Inside?
... It's full of salsa.
Bingo, you sweet little pumpkin!
It's my secret stash. A little snackeroo from me to you...
Mmmm. Yummy. It's delicious...
C'mon, you're just pretending to eat it!

(There was a honeypot of salsa inside the stump.)
(You ate some salsa.)
(It recovered... something.)
(Not HP.) (Just... something.)
Mmm... Hey, what's in this?
I don't know!
Look, if no one else will eat it, I'll try it!
... there's a jar of... Blood...? In here.
No, no. It's merely a pot of free-range salsa.
Thanks, that's actually more gross somehow.
Any time!

Kris...?
Kris, honey, you have grown up so much...
Someday soon you will be going off to university as well...
Remember when you were little...
You asked when your horns were going to grow in?
So we bought that headband with the little red horns on it.
Oh, you wore it for months! Whatever happened to it?
Kris, I need to grade these assignments.
Perhaps you should go to bed...?
You do not look very well...
 Flowers
 Saucer
Chalk
O... Oh, Kris...
D... Did you want to talk about something?
O-Oh, these flowers...? They're from your dad...
He... He always asks how you're doing in school...
... Then gives me a bouquet of them.
... A-actually, that he always gives me flowers...
... R-really makes me w-wonder if he... If he l-likes...
I-if... If he l-likes...
... The awesome comics I lent to him.
Honestly, HE kind of reminds me of a superhero, Kris.
(He's huge and could kick my ass.)
Oh, this saucer of milk?
I-It's for my kitty, MewMew! She's a perfect angel!
... uh? What does she look like...?
W... well, I've never actually s-seen her, b-but...
Ever since I started putting out milk, it's been disappearing.
S... So I'd like to think that there's a cat.
M... My cat.
K... Kris, even though you never got the chalk...
You deserve an award for trying so hard to find it.
So, in return, I can let you borrow, um...
M... My home-made DVD collection of the Symptons!
Y-you know, the sitcom about the middle-class monster family.
It's got every episode in all 28 seasons!
It's the funniest, most quotable show ever...!
But make sure you don't watch past the second season 
Since they just rebooted it as Symptons Turbo 
They all started driving their own motor-vehicles 
And fighting giant giga-demons and stuff 
The main problem about that is that it kind of 
Lost the focus on family that it had earlier 
When their vehicles were shaped like animals 
And they were friends with the animal vehicles too 
And let's not get into Symptons Galaxy Force 
Where the Symptons discover another Earth 
On the other side of the Sun 
WOULDN'T THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD JUST 
... Huh?
... You don't want to watch it?
... Th-That's ok, Kris...
OK, umm, if you ever need help with homework...
My office hours are in this disgusting alley.
H... Heheheh... Umm, tell your mom I said hi.

Hm? What is it now?

Well, well. You have nothing to fix.
But if you find anything BROKEN, return here.
After all, I can fix anything...

Huh---! That CAKE is seething with energy! You must let me fix it!
Huh-hah! Let's feel my technique!

Huh---! That KEY is seething with energy! You must let me fix it!
Well, well. Good journey, my friends.
Your body is a weapon, too. You must take care of it from time to time.
Huh-hah! Let's feel my technique.
Interested in a Choco Diamond? 
All proceeds go to Rudinn Relief Funds, I guess. It's only $40!
Choco Diamonds, only $40, I guess.
Thanks, I guess. (The Choco Diamond was added to your ITEMS.)

You don't have enough money, I guess.
Okay I guess.

May we interest you in a Lancer Cookie?
All proceeds go to kicking your ass.
It's a mere $40.
Heheheh, thanks...
(The LANCERCOOKIE was added to your ITEMs.)
For getting CHEATED by us!!
Now we may fund our illicit plans!!
(You bought LANCERCOOKIE.) (But you didn't have any room.)
(So Lancer just dropped it on the ground and it broke.)
Oops.
Oh well. Buyers cryers.
Thank you anyway for your contribution...
... to getting SWINDLED by us!
Now we can fund our illicit plans!!!
... You don't have enough funds.
What? What did you spend it on!? Pastries!?
That's irresponsible.
Hey! You can't not buy from us!
Hey DUMBASS! It's for a GOOD CAUSE!

HEY, PUNK!!! GET OUT OF THE ROAD!!!
YOU'RE BLOCKIN' TRAFFIC!!!!

Sorry, I'm a little, uh, worked up lately.
This job is SO boring. Nothing EVER happens in this town!
Ngh... I just wish SOMETHING would shake things up!
... Huh? You got somethin' to report?
Got somethin' to report?
... Alphys?
Who's Alphys? No idea who you're talking about.
... Why, did they do something illegal!?
Gotcha, if I see "Alphys," I'll tackle 'em!!
Fuhuhuhu!! They're as good as dead!!
What? There's a Dark World inside the school?
Uh... SURE, kid.
There's no law against Dark Worlds anyway!
That's a job for the school board!
Aww, you wanna help me? Sure, punk.
Get someone to rob the bank so I can suplex them!
... wait, do we even have a bank?
Hey, get someone to build a bank...!
Don't do anything illegal, you little punk!

Little buddy! It's me!
Wanna chat for a minute before I lose my mind?
H... Hey! Hey little buddy! What's up?!
Do you know when Azzy's coming home?
Y... You can't tell him this, but I really miss the guy.
It'd be sweet to cruise around town like old times...
Picking up, for example...
CHICKS
Which, as a matter of course
May not have ever actually happened.
B-but one time Undyne made eye contact with me!
... while she was writing me a speeding ticket.
Make no mistake, little buddy.
ICE-E's P"E"ZZA is H"E"LL.
I can't slack off for SECONDS without hearing...
"Be a team player, there's no I in PEZZA!"
YES THERE IS. YOU JUST TOOK IT OUT.
But it's OK, little buddy. I've been saving up...
... To go to college where Azzy is!
Then I'll get a theater degree, become a famous actor...
And let the fangirls roll in, little buddy.
Ah, yes, Little Buddy. Good idea. Meet the Rogue's Gallery.
Blue Ears - Soft serve obsessed, no concept of personal space.
Keeps accidentally pouring slushies on me and giggling.
The Warrior - Thankfully absent due to pizza-related injuries.
Constantly terrorizing customers with war chants.
Purple Guy - Man, THAT GUY, you gotta...
... actually, does that guy even work here?
Ah, my co-workers. Where would I be without them?
A happy place, little buddy. A much happier place.
It's fine, Little Buddy. You don't have to watch me suffer.
Just enjoy your freedom... While it lasts...
Fruit Juice
Nothing
Kris... What a pleasant surprise to see you here. And on a school day.
There must be a reason that you came here at such a time.
I, Father Alvin, implore you. If you have anything weighing on your mind, please, speak.
Kris, if you want some of our "sick" Fruit Juice, you should come to our service.
Our choir sounds a bit thinner since your brother went away.
Kris, it would be wonderful if you would sing with us.
Or even participated to any extent,
Instead of just trying to drink the Fruit Juice.
I understand. I hope in time you may find the words you seek.
Let the Angel's power light your way.
(Scented markers.)
(You dig out the marshmallow one and start huffing it.)
(The chocolate one smells too fake anyway.)
(It's a toilet.) (Flush it?)
            Yes         No

(It's good to conserve water.)
(It's an obligatory hospital piano, shrunk to fit in the corner.)
(As a result, it's missing most of the good keys.)
(Play it?)

K... Kris!?
Whatever have you been doing!?
I sat in the car waiting for you after school for half an hour...!
I called and called, but you never picked up...
You had your poor mother worried sick!
Kris, I am afraid I am going to have to punish you...
... huh?
... A friend?
You were spending time with... a friend?
...
Kris...
I will make an exception this time.
You can continue your adventures a little longer.
But when you return home...
You are going to have to go to bed early.
See you soon, honey.
Great tosee youagain

someone oughta complain to the guy who runs it.
we just moved here, so i hardly know anyone.
why, got anyone i should know better?
oh, you've got something better to do?
me too.
anyway, i'll be standing here doing nothing.

ah, sorry. i don't hang out with idiot babies.
they compete with my sociological niche.
hey, i gave you a number, what more do you want?
woah there, tiger.
you can't just jump straight into friendship.
it takes time.
alright, that's enough time.
take this.

(You got Sans's Number.)
your mother, huh...?
too late.
i already "befriended" your mom last night.
she's great. came to the store to buy chocolate kisses.
said she's gotta lock her door to stop you from eating 'em.
heheheh... you sound like a fun kid, huh?
alphys. yeah. i know about her.
came into the store with a suitcase and sunglasses.
thought she was part of the mob.
she opened the case and stuffed it full of instant noodles.
paid in small bills,
then slunk out of the place,
pajamas trailing on the floor.
anyway, our relationship is, uh, purely business.
so, uh, i guess i'll just let her do her thing.
harsh, but fair.

Ah, you're an Baby?
Ah, you're an Idiot Baby?
To tell you the truth, I'm one too.

Why'd you call the Hotline for Idiot Babies if you aren't an Idiot Baby?

anyway, thanks for agreeing to hang out with him.
 Susie
 Key
Anything
Oh, hi, Kris!
Did you need help with your homework again?
I know you were having trouble last time, so, um,
I actually got a few things ready for you, in case --
Ah, wait, sorry! I can't right now...
I forgot my house key again, and...
Sorry, Kris, I'll help you later, if that's ok.
See you at school, Kris!
...
Umm, Kris?
Did you... want to talk about something?
Hi Kris! Is something up?
 She's nice
 Terrible
Eats Chalk
...
Susie! That's right, you were with Susie!
When you didn't come back to class, I was worried, but...
Everything turned out OK! I think?
... Umm, Kris? Can I ask something, if that's OK?
Susie... I'm kind of... curious what she's like, you know?
I mean, who DOESN'T wonder about her? She never talks to anyone.
So, Kris, could you tell me about her? If that's ok...
Oh, can I ask something else about her!?
Well, did it seem like, she, um...
(W-wait, you definitely wouldn't know THAT...)
... huh? Why don't I ask my mom for the key?
I... I mean, um... I... you know,
She doesn't like it when I bother her when she's working.
Don't worry, OK? I'll just go over to Catti's.
Umm... Kris...? Are you feeling alright?
Normally you're not so... talkative.
Oh! I don't mean to sound like something's wrong with you.
...
Umm, Kris, is something wrong?
Why did you go to the hospital to see my dad...?
I mean, I'm sure he appreciated it, but... um...
Gosh, I'm sorry, Kris. Forget I said anything!
Tell Azzy I said hi, Kris!
What...? She's... a nice person?
Really!? L-like, really!? Honestly!? Truly!?
I mean, that's just what I was hoping, but...
W-wait, this isn't another trick, is it, Kris?
Like when you put ketchup on your arms and told me it was blood?
... R-really? You're serious? You're totally serious?
... gosh, then maybe I should try talking to her...
B-but if I die, you're paying for my funeral, Kris!
(Though, honestly, if she's nice I might die, too...)
She WHAT? She smashed you against the LOCKERS?
Gosh, Kris, I'm really sorry. That's just awful.
I... I'd THOUGHT Susie was good, just...
Maybe it would take someone special to find her good side.
... but she really IS terrible, isn't she...?
Kris... I'm SO sorry you have to go through this.
In fact, I wonder if... d-do you think...?
I wonder if Alphys would let us switch partners, I mean?
You know, so you wouldn't have to be the one, who, um,
Gets to be, slammed into lockers, and stuff, anymore.
(Wait, I don't think I phrased that correctly...)
What? She was EATING the chalk???
R... really...?
Wait! You're teasing me, aren't you, Kris?
L-like when you told me ICE-E was real and eats kids...
So Dess smacked you with a wiffle bat 'til you stopped lying.
... Huh? You're telling the truth? Seriously?
Umm, then... what color chalk does she like?
And, do you think she likes the thin or the thick kind...?
(Wait, maybe making her a lunchbox full of chalk is stupid...)
Seriously, Kris? But I help you ALL the time!
The LEAST you can do is give me a LITTLE information!
Like, d-does she like metal music!?
Is she really an obligate carnivore!?
D... Does she really have a tail underneath her jacket!?
Or, or... or...
Sorry Kris, it's not any of my business, is it...?
(I blew it, didn't I...)

BUT I'M FAST, FAST, CLEVER, CLEVER.

Huh? Free? But you're clearly the one behind bars...

Well, sounds like you don't need any help, then.
THAT IS UN-SO. I GROW LONELY IN MY LITTLE FREEDOM.
SO, SHALL YOU PLAY A GAME WITH ME, ME...?
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FREE!
FIND THE KEY, AND I'LL LET YOU BE FREE, FREE.
THE KEY IS HIDDEN FROM THE EYES. THE OLD SHOPKEEPER KNOWS A SECRET.
BOO HOO, BOO HOO, UEE HEE HEE!!

Heh, you wanna act that way, huh...?
Forgive me or I'll crush you, dweeb!!

Well, then what are we waiting for?

Kris? What is it, honey?
Remember that video-game you and Asriel used to play?
What was it called...? Super Smashing Fighters?
When he was very little, he LOVED the green lizard from that.
We even had a birthday party for him themed around it.
Your father painted all these eggs with spots as decoration...
Oh, your brother LOVED it...!
Until the next day, your father cooked them all for breakfast.
Your brother just kept crying...
Ever since, he's hated that book about eating green eggs!
Kris, since only you and I are living here right now...
It feels... just a bit lonely, does it not...?
But, fortunately, sharing a warm, freshly-made pie,
Is the perfect cure for such a condition.
... as long as I get to eat some, of course.
Oh, Kris...? Flowers? For your mother...?
How sweet...
...
These are from HIM, are they not.
Err, well, worry not, Kris, I will...
... find some place for them.
Kris, perhaps you should go to bed early tonight...
You do not look quite yourself.

This whole partner thing...
You didn't lose sleep over it, did you?
You say, with no negative intonation at all.
...
Kris, as your teacher, there's, um, a...
A limit. To the advice I'm qualified for.
But if you're interested, I do have a recommendation.
There's, an, FPS game podcast that helps me sleep...
No? Okay.
H... huh? Kris, that's, um... good? I think?
So maybe you were just...
Staying up late talking to Asriel online again?
... ah, wait, you... can't do that, right?
I... I hope the internet gets fixed soon.

He's gonna be so proud of me!!!

Ah, Little BUDDY. How do I PUT it...
I... don't actually know!! I haven't met her in real life!!
But from the way she TEXTS?
God, Little Buddy. She must be STACKED.
Little buddy!! Here to hear about my, heh, GIRLFRIEND!?
So far, she's the perfect girl, little buddy.
She loves pizza.
AND bikinis!
And to top it off... she sent me a picture.
Of herself. Wearing a pizza bikini.
Little buddy, perhaps it is uncouth, but...
Look!!! LOOK AT THIS!!!! GOD DAMN!!!!
(It's several pixels that vaguely resemble a zoomed-in JPEG of a pepperoni pizza.)

Yes, I know what you're thinking, Little Buddy.
Her camera. Is not. Of the highest caliber.
But to a scholarly man of the world like myself,
This is what love looks like, Little Buddy.
That's right!! We don't need to say any more!!
Go ahead and tell Asriel right now!!!

Makes me wonder if she even needs the police...
Or if they're just... g... getting in her way?
... eheh sorry. I'm just saying what you already know.
After all, she's...
Your neighbor, right?
Oh, how's your project going with, err... Susie?
What? Y-you went to the LIBRARY?! Together!?
With Noelle and Berdly!? Th-that's amazing, Kris!!
And, um... while you were there...
This has nothing to do with me, but the Teen Zone...
Seems to have some... g-good anime reviews, you know?
Not sure if you and the gang, were,
Ch-checking that out as you studied?
Next time you go you might want to...
Casually bring that up, among your fellow teens.
I... I know your dad liked Mew Mew 2 at least!!
A-again, nothing to do with me!! Eheheh!!
S-see you tomorrow, Kris!
U-umm, there's, no school tomorrow though!!
... hey!!

Didja miss... me?
Oh!!! I was missed!!!
My existence!! Being acknowledged!!
Feels good, y'hear!!
Y'hear... Y'hear closely for a second.
Y'hou're my friend. Right?
As my friend... Do you wanna... y'hear a secret?
Sometimes... I hear a song at night.
Just a little piece of a song, y'hear.
It sounds like... it's coming from under the water. Deep.
Do... Do you think....
Someone's auditioning for my band!?
Oh, I'm about to make another friend! I can feel it, y'hear!!
Do you wanna y'hear another secret...?
... I think...
Maybe...
... I've heard that song before... coming from the sea.
The whole thing.
It's not a "new" song.
But... I can't remember... I can't... Can't remember, y'hear!
I'm going to investigate, y'hear!
Come back here tomorrow, y'hear!

Yeah, let's just drop the act!
Our last adventure was great, right?!
I couldn't stop thinking about having another!
I don't know what's in there, but...
We can't live if we don't find out, right!?
...
Kris, you're right.
Like, you said a correct fact.
But you made a mistake.
The mistake of knowing me.
'Cause when I see a big pit,
All I wanna do is jump in.
And as long as you're with me...
I'm dragging you in too!

(snicker, snicker)
Like, Lil Krissy, you hear? That, uh, guy at the pizza place?
God, what was his name? Pizzapants?
Heard he got, like, a SUPER hot girlfriend.
What was her name? Like, uh....
Hahahah... haha... Pizza...rina? Hahahah.
Anyway, what, did you like, wanna talk?
Lil Krissy. Come to visit me in my alley?
Hahaha. I'm a real alley-gator, aren't I?
Krissy, like, GUESS what?
Today I like, went to the beach to play my uke, and...
Like, guess who's ALREADY there?
That COPYCAT, playing the same song I wanted to play.
Oh my god. Cat on the beach. Grody.
Did she, like, get lost looking for the litter box?
So like, I try to like, play the same song, too...
To, you know, assert my ukelele dominance.
And we end up, ugh - get this -
Playing the whole song. TOGETHER.
Like, oh my god, who does this girl think she IS?
She thinks she can just, like, HARMONIZE with me!?
Ugh. I can't STAND her.
(OMG, it's, like, SO sweet you have a nasty dirty little friend.)
(But like... this is MY polluted alleyway? So like...)
(I think I might have to go to the mayor and get a traffic sign?)
(That says like, no plus-ones. Because, like... okay?)
Oh, like, you, like, just like, like alleys?
Oh my god. Like, me too. I LOVE alleys.
Like, don't even THINK you can like them as much as me.
Talk More
Don't talk more
catty
OMG my little sis is SOOOOO CUTE in her outfit!!!
Krissy, like, listen to the song I made about her!!!
"Catti's the best! Catti's the best!
She curses me, every day Glares 'cause I'm in her way 
Catti's the best sister ever!!"
Hahaha!!! Anyway, what's up, Krissy!?
What's up, Kris?
OMG Krissy you're not going to believe this!!!
I was at the beach playing ukelele, right? And...
Like, that green alligator evil neighbor girl, like -
INVADED and started, like, playing MY song!!

Gerson
Hammer
Asriel
Kris. Welcome.
Did you seek something from me?
It's been a few years since my father passed on...
Fans of his famous book series, Lord of the Hammer...
We still received condolences from them until just recently.
A brave man, brilliant, and sharp.
Kris, it is a shame you were not able to have him as a teacher.
And, difficult for Ms. Alphys, as his replacement.
Let us pray that the Angel will smile upon her.
As per the ritual, a hammer is buried in the earth here.
To symbolize his existence.
To connect his spirit to the divine.
Originally a smith by trade, he began writing history...
And made a turn into telling stories,
As a means to entertain his children.
That such a story, created for a such a simple purpose,
Could blossom into such a large, wonderful, world-changing thing...
That is the majesty of words, Kris.
My father was blessed to have such a talent for writing.
Ah, Kris. Your brother. He is a very kind young man.
Perhaps even a little... overzealous, in his younger days.
He would visit me often to confess... to various, "sins".
Despite the absence of sin, or confession, in our religion.
I remember his small face, sobbing, as he admitted he had,
"Dropped the lizard in the pit to jump high."
Nearly omitting the fact that he had done so in a "videos game."
He also confessed to various "sins" on your behalf,
Begging for your forgiveness for "dropping the lizard on purpose."
I would always "forgive" him and send him home.
Good day, Kris. May the Angel watch over you...

Sorry, I... heheh.
Used up... a lot of my energy just now.
Probably... not gonna be very fun to talk to.
Thanks for visiting though, Kris.
And you too, Susie.
What is it, Krismas?
Heheh... seems like, I need some more tests.
So just... gotta wait it out.
They can't keep me down for too long, baby!
Sooner or later... I'm bustin' out of here!
coughcon
Hey, Kris, she's a nice girl, huh?
The hell you taking her HERE for?
Why don't you take her to the movies?

Hey, yeah, the hell didn't we go to the movies, Kris?
Yeah! And take me too while you're at it!
Yeah, Kris! C'mon!!
Kettle corn, Kris! Big! Don't skimp out!
(Look, Kris. Can't say much, but...)
(Noelle... might look like she has it all.)
(But her mother. Her mother, you know?)
(Love her, but... she's... tough on her.)
(Normally, I balance it all out.)
(But...)
(I can't... do much. When I'm not there.)
(But I'm gonna get better.)
(I have to.)
Yeah, get on outta here and do something fun!

There's 5 dollars in your brother's drawer. Take it?
(You have already taken enough.)
You reluctantly "borrowed" 5 dollars.
It isn't yours, after all.

What. What? WHAT!?
If you're looking for Blooky, they aren't here!!
... unless you're looking for someone else?
Me? Me? ME!?!
What have I got to say to YOU!? Nothing!!
Like I'd even recognize a pathetic face like THAT!
By the way, say hi to your dad for me!
WAIT!! WAIT!! DON'T do that!! He doesn't know I -- Nothing!!
... Fine! FINE! FINE!!! Wanna talk to someone else!? Here!
... Oh my, someone's here to see me?
visitedyest
... It's you again, is it, darling?
Ohh my. Why do you keep coming to our door?
Are you... a fan of mine?
Haha... as if someone could be a fan of a "nobody" like me.
Well, if you are a fan. Haha. Could I bother you for a favor?
... How odd. Knocking on a stranger's door.
Don't you have any manners, darling?
Well.
A nobody like me can't be picky with their company, I suppose.
Allow me to take this chance to ask you something.
Since the internet went down, I haven't had much...
Entertainment.
If you have anything entertaining, darling...
Could you bring it by to me tomorrow?
It would mean the world to me. Thank you.
... Are you still there, darling?
Oh my. So obsessed with a nobody like me.
It's almost as if you're... a fan of mine.
... Go home, darling.
Then leave! Leave! LEAVE!!!

There's a fork in the path... Kris, it seems like...
It might be advantageous if we split up.
Who do you want to go with?
Yeah
Not yet
Kris, you going home?
Huh...?
Umm, sure, alright, yeah!
Wondering
Don't care
... Kris...
... Are you wondering how Susie is doing right now?
Well then... why don't we close our eyes...
... and think about what she's doing now?
Reallydon't care
... Err, are you sure?
It might be interesting... you aren't wondering at all?
Perhaps, if you could potentially see it, would you want to?
... Well then, I suppose if you aren't interested, that's that.
Let's keep going, Kris.

Yep! That's right! We're friends!

Yeah, that's the attitude!
Ugh, what if Ralsei became a teacher's pet, though?
Or, not if. Just feels like a matter of time, honestly.
Well, whatever. As long as he brings ME an apple, too.
...
What? Apple shampoo? No, I didn't drink any of that.
Of course not
Kris, do you think of me as your lackey...?
R-really? I'm... I'm happy to hear that!
(I've never been someone's lackey before...)
H-huh...? Y-you mean...

Wh-why do those mice keep attacking me?!

H-huh? No way! If that's the case...
Get them to just give me a lunchbox instead!
(Only Kris would say "unknown", not "I don't know.")
(... then keep standing there like that.)

(Are they waiting for me to stop mumbling?)
Then, Kris... m-maybe you can take your sword...
And be the hero that protects me from the mice?

(... What you saw surprised you.  ... sort of.)
(It's wallpapered with the pink cat ad from the city. It's animated, too.)
(... it's beautiful.)
HAHAHA!! Kris, who's room is THIS!?
... huh? Your brother?
HAHAHA!!! Man, you better hope I never meet him...!
(You opened the door with your eyes closed. You saw nothing.)
(You respected the Gamer's Code. No screen peeking.)
(You can smell the glittery cat food from here anyway.)
(You feel like Noelle would enjoy this more.)
(You have the feeling you wouldn't learn anything.)
I will ridewith you
Susie wouldn't
Susie would
(It's an advertisement for a giant ferris wheel.)
Gosh, that's amazing!
Makes the one at the festival look like a toy, haha!
I... I wonder if Susie would want to...
... Gosh, who am I kidding?
Oh, so you can shake it when we reach the top?
Just like at the festival when we were kids?
I KNOW there's a catch with you, Kris! NO thanks!
Y-you're right! Even if I asked her, she'd...
Probably just laugh at me.
And, gosh, push me to the ground, and...
L-laugh at me some more, and then...
(... What were we talking about again?)
R-really? Y-you really think so?
Faha, and coming from Susie Expert Kris! Thanks!
(Hey, Kris, how'd YOU become the Susie Expert!?)
Noelle willride with me
Sorry
... h... huh?
I mean... S-sure, if you, um... really want to!
You can, um, make up for when we were kids!
(... Since when did Kris get so...)
(N... no way, it's gotta be some kind of prank!)
Um, it's ok, I know you can't help being a goof.
We ALL know you can't help it! Fahaha!!
(It's a bed. Go to sleep?)
K-Kris, what if Noelle came in here...?
Yeah, what if she has ticks? Get out of there!

Sure, I guess... we could ask about it.
How much does it cost?
Just a small fee of $1!
Huh? S-sorry, we don't have that much money!
(Still, it was nice of Kris to offer...)
Y-yeah, we don't need anything like that.
Huh? Me...?
You... were asking ME to get it?
Kris, c'mon, you know we can't afford that...
Wh... what?
Kris, I just told you, we... we don't have the money.
What... what are you asking me to do...?
You... you aren't asking me to just...?
K-Kris, no, I... not me, I could never...
I...
To see your father
To see you
(Come on, it... it was just a bad dream...)
(Even so, it was so real, I can't get it out of my mind...)
(... that voice, telling me what to do.)
(A voice unlike Kris's...)
(... a terrifying voice...)
(Kris...)
(Recently, there's been something... different... about them.)
(Why hasn't anyone else noticed it...?)
(I... I have to figure it out.)
(Why Kris is acting so strange...)
(Why they keep coming... to the hospital...)
H-huh!?
K-Kris... how long have you been standing there!?
Phew, you... haha, you really scared me, you know?
(Keep it together, Noelle...)
(There's nothing to be afraid of...)
(After all, a dream is just a dream, right...?)

Because itwasn't adream
(... th-then...)

(So terrifying?)
S-stop! Don't come any closer!
Hey, Kris! Let's beat it already.
Man, he kept telling me about Noelle, like...
Her favorite things, places she'd like to go...
No idea what the hell that was about.
So, uh, the hell were you two doing?
F
O-oh, u-um, n-nothing, Susie!
I was... I was just about to go home! U-umm... see you!
Guess she's afraid of me again, huh...
Man... would be nice...
If she knew everything that happened was real, huh, Kris?
C'mon, try to be a little more enthusiastic. Heh.

H... how?
There's nowhere to go.
Kris, there's... the path is blocked, isn't it?
Kris... what are you doing?
Kris, is... is everything okay?
Kris, there's lightning in the way...
If... if we move any further... I'll be... I'll be...

Recruits
Item storage
Controls
Do not read
(It's a manual. Read a topic?)
If you SPARE or PACIFY enough enemies of the same type, they will be RECRUITed.
RECRUITs will appear in your TOWN. Wonder what happens if you get them all...?
You can check the area's RECRUIT status at SAVE POINTS. Certain BOSSES are excluded.
You will now have access to a STORAGE menu at SAVE POINTS.
When you're out of space, ITEMs you find or BUY will be sent to your STORAGE.
Feel free to put things inside you might not be able to use yet.
Here is a reminder of the controls. Change them in the config menu.
1 Confirm and interact with things.
1 Cancel. Hold to RUN. Shows all text instantly.
1 Opens the menu. Hold down to quickly skip textboxes.
(There's no time to read books.)
Oh, Kris! It's a free editable CYBERPEDIA! I'll add an entry...!
(Ralsei wrote an article about LOSING RECRUITS. Read it?)
From now on, defeating enemies with violence will make them LOST.
LOST enemies cannot become RECRUITs ever again.
But, the bonds you break may make you stronger...
(Who has time to read a book in the Cyber World?)
(It's a mannequin.)
(Put the LoadedDisk inside?)
(The LoadedDisk squirmed and won't fit!)
(Something is glimmering in the hole.)
(Look inside?)

(You reached inside and found something alongside a strange piece of glass...)
Kris, want to re-read my editable CYBERPEDIA entry?
Yeah you did.

H-how about this? If no one speaks up...

Hey, there might be a box in the supply closet...
Miss Alphys, why don't Susie and I...
Why don't you go get it for me...?
And K... Kris... Can you go with her and make sure she...
Um, actually gets it? And, um, stays out of trouble...?
Thanks Kris! See you later!
Kris, there you are!

In any case, good morning, Class!
We have a lot to go over today...
First, we're starting the reading from page 142!
Any... any volunteers?
Umm, I... I guess I could read the...
Ah, trouble yourself not, Noelle!
I will valiantly take this blow of humiliation!!
Umm, t-that's OK, I can...
A-HEM.
"Page 142."
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,"
"Times-a pretty good. Times-a pretty bad."
"Mediocre times. Iffy times. So-so times..."
Listening to this, your eyes began to close automatically...

And P-PLEASE! Remember your group projects!
Oh, um... Kris? Are... you okay?
You were, um, s-sleeping all class...

(Usually you only sleep through the start.)
... Kris... Where did you and Susie go yesterday?
...
Um, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay.
I was just really... worried about you.
If... If Susie causes you any trouble, then...
Okay, I... I can't really do anything. Eheh.
But... I'm looking out for you, okay?
Good luck and rest well tonight, okay?

I walked right up and told her she was a HOT piece of work.

Yeah, she slapped me so hard I blacked out!
Hahaha...! Dad, that doesn't help at all!
Anyhow, how's Dragon Blazers III? Beat it yet?
Nah, I'm still at the Ice Palace. I've been kind of...

Maybe... Maybe you shouldn't wait.
D... Dad?
You should bring it HERE! I'm bored as hell!

Yes, we should all discuss that together soon.

Of course. Have a nice day.

free pickles.
Why, thank you!
Can I ask?
What kind of flowers, do you think,
Would make her remember how she felt before?
uhh...
maybe you should talk to your plants about that.
Haha! Don't worry. They're the first ones I asked!
They're such good listeners, you know. Flowers.
well, yeah. nothin' like a captive audience.
Yes, haha. I even keep them in glass.

It's a red wagon with a rusty birdcage in it.
Looks like it's seen quite a few crashes.
It's a birdcage. When the door's closed, there's no escape.

(It's just a dummy.)

Without trees, I must gain nutrients by eating clothes...
Such is the way of the worm.
I'm a worm. I don't understand taxes and values.

It's not'n no fault of yours.
He'll'n be back one day.
Whoa, horsies. You've'n brought us to a great new place.
We'll'n be puttin' our own elbow grease into fixin' it, too.
Well'n, maybe not elbow'n grease. That's gross.
Nostril grease?
We'll'n be tryin' our best too. Greasily.
We're'n building up the area to be a bit'n more board-like.
The ponmen'll be happy, too.

Hi Susie!!
Wh... who did this to my mannequin!?
A-as your prince, I... I demand someone fix this!!

Umm, is... is anybody listening...?

So Ralsei, you're not gonna put your hat back on?

You're making me blush!
Hurry the hell up, Kris.
Longer you take, longer I gotta spend with THIS weirdo.
If you're bored, Susie, we could crochet some team scarves...
Wait, "Kro-shay?" Isn't that the, uh, game with the hammer?
Er... it's like knitting.
Alright. Long as I get to use the hammer.
... so the hell were you hugging that Ralsei Statue?
Let Kris do what they want, Susie! 
Also, it's not a statue?
The hell you even have a Ralsei statue anyway?
Susie wants to practice hugging too?   
KRIS HURRY UP ALREADY!
Oh! Let us take your coat! And put it in the TOILET! HA! ... which, we don't even have.

Hey short-stuff. Why would YOU possibly need to talk to the mayor?
Your allowance too low? Ate too much candies? Lost your frisbee in the wash?
Hey, short-stuff...
That's what the cops are for.
What? Don't talk to you like you're a "kid?" Fine...
If you need someone to change your diaper, go ask the Cop's.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The mayor is busy right now.
If you need to see her, please try causing some terrible crisis.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Are you here to complain about your teacher?
If you don't like her, please blame your mother for getting her hired...
The mayor's charisma is about zero. No, it's negative.
But she works hard and has a good track record, so she runs unopposed.
Thaaaaaat's politics. Rarely.
Not only does she act icy, she always keeps her office's AC on full blast.
That chill I feel... is... Is this what politics feels like?
Oh, I'm sorry. You're looking for the mayor.
She's very, very busy preparing for the festival.
Well well. If it isn't the teens. Our beloved "rats of the city."
You wanna get into Politics? Heh.
You better graduate from Diaper School first.
That's what I did. And look at me now.
I don't even work here.
This Briefscase, is full of Diapers. Or, to the Pro's, "Diaps."
You're gonna have to level up to understand a Man's World.

Uh, we'll take the special, and do you have any edible glitter...?
The youngest one won't eat anything if it doesn't look like treasure...
In a pinch, sprinkles will work, too...
Don't be a stranger now, alright, hun?
Hey there! Haven't seen you in a while, hun.
I remember, back on Sundays, after service...
You and your family would come in and order the special.
'Course, things happened, and then...
Y'all... Stopped comin' together.
But every Sunday, you and your brother'd still come in.
He'd order you a hot chocolate...
And you two'd sit down at that table in the corner...
... drawin' shapes in the window with your breath.
You must really miss him, huh?
... Here, how about this?
(Kris got the Hot Chocolate.)
On the house, hun.
... You know, I'd give you a hot chocolate on the house...
... But it looks like you've got enough things already.
Take it easy, okay, hun?
So, for you two girls, that'll be the crepes, a cinnamon latte...
Two bunny parfaits, and... a piece of firewood...?
And, how would you like that firewood done?
Dude, remember when we used to skip the first hour of class to come here?
YOU were fine, but I almost had to repeat the year 'cause of it...
Those crepes were MAD worth, though! Delinquency is the best condiment!
Dude, if we didn't bring Gerson our leftovers, I bet I would have failed HARD...
Looking at my rugged body, you must wonder what kind of secrets I hold...
My secret is, I put all my leftover pancakes in this giant hat.
Whew! I sure love PANCAKE!

So they can come in and cheer her on.
Never seen anything like it, but it's kind of nice, isn't it?
How you doin', hon?
... what? Sorry, couldn't hear you over the noise.
Hey hon, how did you like the hot chocolate?
... well, I'm gonna take it that means you enjoyed it.
Take it easy, okay? I'm sure your brother will be back in no time.
Catti's, My friend. And.
I support my friends, through thick, and thin.
Long, and short. Cold, and hot.
Whatever shape, the world takes, I'll be there.
Life is a big, ballgame,
And when the man is on the field.
He does a big dunk.
Try, to be that dunk.
Our little Catti, she's doin' us proud.
Workin' hard. Supportin' us.
Servin' us pickles, terrifyin' us with their shape,
Tryin' to get us to leave.
Proud of her.
My favorite meal? Gotta be the catfood pancakes!
And the fish with bones that looks like it's from a cartoon.
To tell you the truth, I thought this was the post office...
But by the time I realized... I'd already sat down...
I'm not hungry, so I've just been telling the waitress I'm still deciding for...
... a few hours now. How am I supposed to get out of this one!?
I don't know if you noticed, but I've been getting stronger.
You could say I'm bulking up for the winter.
Oh boy! I love BULKING.
This guy next to me, he's really bulked up. I admire that.
I don't know if you do that, bulking up for the winter...
H-How am I supposed to get past this blue lady...!? I'm stuck!!
I-I guess I should just run away...
Police Chief Undyne is supposed to be directing traffic...
But all she's doing is standing in the middle of the street yelling "GET OUT OF MY WAY!!!"
She's the best, huh!? I feel really directed!!!
Traffic's moving at a snail's pace.
I love snails. Could today get any better!?
Wow, my first traffic jam!!
I can't help but feel a sense of pride...

I heard a dog was doing "donuts" so I sped over here.

Yo, Kris! You survived Susie, haha!
I mean, I never saw her beat anyone up, but, uh, I'd be careful.
Like, one time me, Snowy, and Jockington were playing handball,
And she just kept creepily watching us from the corner.
Then, when the ball rolled over to her she just, uh, froze solid...
... and kicked the ball as hard as she could, right into Officer Undyne's car!
Then, Undyne came out, smiling, cracked her knuckles, and totally wiped us at handball...
Anyway, Susie sucks, Kris, haha. 
Yo, Kris, you look kind of annoyed. Everything OK?
You can calm down now, dude! Susie's not here, haha!
... Huh? You look even more annoyed...
HOOH!! You're lucky, Kris!! 
You got to miss class with Alphys! It's not fair! Ha ha ha!
If I skipped class, my dad'd never let me hear the end of it!!! Ha ha ha!!!
... That's actually not even remotely funny.
This is a great parking place!
I can see myself settling down here...
Home is where the car is!
I just wanna go home, but I'm still stuck in a traffic jam...
... even though it's only one other person...
That's the trouble with cars.
If you wanna do donuts, you have to be prepared for jam!
You kids came out of the library, didn't you? Studying... How wonderful.
Personally, I hate libraries, but...
Libraries are outdated. We have things like newspapers now.
Hey neighbor-beighbor! When's yah brother Doug gonna come by? Huh huh huh!
My girls'd love to see him! He's a sweet little man!
He's just got one problem... He doesn't like my wife's cookin'!
What's wrong, Douglas? You don't like frozen cat food? Huh huh huh!
Can't blame yah brother for leavin' town.
He's out there, gettin' a big brain in the big school.
Hope when he becomes a big shot, he remembers us little guys down the street.
Eatin' oranges and gettin' our stomachs pumped.
Ribbit, ribbit.
(I sometimes hear beautiful singing from that house over there.)
(How eerie... could it be a ghost?)
Ribbit.
(That would make sense. A ghost lives there.)
My brother's too old to take for a walk anymore... hm...
I'm aimless... wish I had someone to whip me into shape.
I wanted to buy flowers, but the store's closed.
The door around back's unlocked, but I don't think I should go in...
I saw a bed through the back window... Wonder what the deal is.
I'm not Jerry. I'm Terry.
I'm super cool.
I totally DON'T have to go to the bathroom.
Oh!!! Terry!! Say it again!!
Say you don't have to go to the bathroom again!!
Nothing like admiring the great paint job, me and my bro did on our church.
.... missed a spot.
We tried to play baseball, but that kid kept dancing in the middle of the lot.
I... don't feel like there's any way to stop him...
If I can't stop him... Should I join him? No... no.
Oh, it's you. Are you here to play the piano again?
The patients can't hear it well from here, but I personally enjoy it.
Sometimes the police chief comes in to play the piano.
Her playing is nice, but when she starts singing...
We have to ask her to leave.
Hmmm... you usually play the piano a bit more... beautifully.
Is everything OK? You DO seem a little sick...
Here to make an appointment...?
Nah, just here to hang out.
... I see.
Should I pencil you in for hanging out?
Nothin' better than hangin' at the lake with my best bro...
Watchin' the waves go by...
... true.
Wow, my co-worker seems so energetic lately!!
I don't know what's happened, but....
Seeing him happy makes me happy too!!

(Susie's talk tube thing. Looks a bit bigger for her larger head.)
I heard the rollercoasters are undergoing maintenance.
That's a pain because it's our only form of public transit.
Are the roller coasters still broken? Too bad.
I keep petitioning for a public merry-go-round, but...
Yes. The teacup ride is privately owned.
There was some ex-famous guy, some salesman-lobbyist-type...
He was afraid of clowns, so he kept it from happening.

Spamton? ... Haven't heard that name in a long time.
Spamton? ... We don't talk about that around here.
I wanted to buy something...
But I think all of the shopkeepers went to the trash dump...
That's a shame... I wanted to get ripped off.
Since everyone else got plugged they're a lot more agreeable.
It's nice.
Pretty much everyone else is a Werewire now.
Kind of wondering if I'm holding everything back...
I'm not even sure I would make a good Werewire.
Hey, got any way to deal with crushing, existential dread?
Asking for a friend.
A friend that looks, and sounds, exactly like me.
Ah, you two don't look together!
Can I interest you in some brand new Divorcing Shoes...?
Ah, you three look together! How about some marriage shoes?
Spamton? ... No idea who you're talking about.
Buy! Buy! Buy! We're sold out! Buy!
(It's a bit scary moving to a new place. But, as a ball...)
(There's nothing to sphere except sphere itself.)
(With this windfall, I've ceased to be spherical.)
(Nubert... you're one-of-a-kind.)
Prince Ralsei, I will keep your hat a-racked until you need it!
Until then, please allow me to pretend to be a wizard! Hi-ya!
Ho ho!! Who is this guy!! He's scary!!
Nubert's had a wild ride. Time to settle down.
Give my riches to the weak...
Ah! Thou hast Transplantedeth us to Thine Castle Towne...
And, Trulye, a maginificenth Towne of Castles, it art!
But ho! Hmmm... Something art... Lackingth, it Feeleth.

Forthhence, I do All the Cookinge and Cleaninge.
Perhapsth, I shouldst seeketh a New Employere...
Oho. Welcome to 1Town!
Or so I heard it's called.
Oho. Welcome home.
Things have changed again here in 1Town!
Come to think of it,
Welcome to me too! Haha!
I think we're gonna like living here!
This is a dream that grows with love and care.
Don't be afraid to dream!
Ha ha! That's right! They took so long on their turn...
What!? A horned girl? I never got to see her!
This guy always seems like he's enjoying life more than me.
Maybe it's because he's a higher level...?
(Seems Hathy likes this place.)
(She hopes you'll find enough beds to inspect.)
(You'll lose your bed inspector title if you don't inspect enough beds.)
(Seems like Hathy likes this place.)
(She hopes you'll like it too.)
(Hathy's happy to see so many new faces.)
(Happy's hathy.)
It's a clean start for us here!
(Sukkiri...)
Thanks for getting rid of Queen!
... yeah, this form is much cooler, so I'm keeping it...
Thanks to you, commander, we've been liberated!
I hereby declare today National Ham Sandwich Day of Independence!
Wh... what a wonderful place... thank you...
This town, not that restaurant. It looks weird. I'm not going in...
Bow bow.
(I'm bjust a block.)
(I don't bget it.)
(Did bwe go somebwhere?)
I... thought you were racing?
Yeah! I wanna be the egg!!
You won't get through your teen years without at least one Egg.
Good evening, boss. Today's meal is Crisped `E23D28.
It's been deep-fried with the finest JPEG artifacting...
I hope it suits your palette... er, palate.
Boss, this Cafe is so unrefined. So plain.
Why don't we make it into an animal cafe?
... you can be one of the animals, too, boss.
(Seems well behaved.)
RIKO RIKO!
Oh, it's quite a wonderful town, really. Thank you!
... so... why am I alone here?
A bit of self-reflection, I suppose.
I do realize I was quite a coward before...
So... I wanted to say... well...
I STILL AM!!!!
My cards, I cannot handle society!
For now, I'll be living at the top of this cliff!
When I'm ready to meet society again, I will be back!
Thank you, thank you for the wonderful home! I will NOT use it!
Thanks a lot for the lovely city.
It's nearly as good as the one I made in Minecrap.
I need to mine ten-hundred blocks of Bubsidian to make my dog 3 colors.
... I like being like this.
Don't tell anybody.
These animals are stray...?
No, they are practicing a special loneliness style.
... Just like me.
Lone wolves have to stick together.
Train at the party dojo? Ha...
We will make our own dojo... for introverts.
... I've been training.
... Don't ask what I've been training, though.
... are you impressed...?
*		Wow, our house is a dojo?! 	Makes me wanna FIGHT... 	(Can't we go to sleep?)
*		It's a PARTY every day! 	And I'M the oldest! 	(We're the same age...)
*		Who's that tall-dark-and... 	Kinda creepy person!? 	You mean the... Werewire?
*		Their neck just 	looks so...fluffy 	So!? Like I care!?
*		(She wants to rub her face 	in it...)
He he he... Looks like fighting wasn't in the cards for us.
Lucky for you... Just hope you don't meet my friends!
(Looks like it won't forgive you for sparing it...)
(Unless you can beat it in a fight.)
Finally a dojo for people that are normal-shaped
I will train my self for the tournament
My power level is falling behind the others
All I can do now is gasp and comment on the battle
Looks like you got past Nubert's forcefield.
Nubert doesn't know how that forcefield got there.
But it's Nubert's forcefield.
As a prize, have Nubert's treasure.
Nubert doesn't know what's inside.
But Nubert will give it to you.
That's Nubert's treasure.
Remember. You're just borrowing it.
Forever.
All my friends turned into Werewires, but it's no big deal.
I've been on Queen's side since the beginning, so I'm safe!
Complain about Queen, but she gets a lot done!
Heh, good luck figuring out which ride to take!
This right ride is the right one.
I love reading books.
Especially the books upstairs.
I love reading.
Especially books.
swatchLines
Thank you for your help.
It's terrible... The butlers are all trapped in the cafe...
Queen is nowhere to be found, and...
With no one to defend it, a strange force has taken over the mansion!
Welcome to the 2F Dinner Party Section A.
Please help yourself to anybody's food.
Normally I'm terrified of mice, but it's OK because that one is wearing a wig.
I am Mousemillian. I stand leagues and inches above all the other mice.
Only Nubert remains above me still...
miceGold
(What have you done!?)
(You gave the other mice $1 during that puzzle!)
(At this rate, EVERY mouse is going to be wearing a wig...)
Nubert's movin' up in the world.
Yes! Yes! Queen is right! Send error report! Send error report!
Couldn't agree more! Send error report! Send error report!
Psst... Hey, it's me, the Hacker. No one figured it out but it's me.
Keep it on the download.
Psst... I'm the Hacker. Nobody figured it out yet but it's me.
There's an east treasure's hallway leading to BASEMENT on 1F...
Come down there and I'll help you crack the code.
This guy keeps telling everyone at the party he's a hacker.
I don't know what to do with this information.
There's supposed to be another guest here, but they're late.
They called and said something about blue checkmarks...
This downstairs table will be for our special guests.
There's a dinner party on the 2nd floor for everyone else.
Combined, we have enough seats for everyone in the world.
Everything here is tailored for you... right?
Ralsei, good luck.
Although you only joined us for minutes, we'll miss you.
(He seems to be well-taken care of.)
When are they gonna be done in there?
(The statue of Berdly is wedged in the toilet.)
(You glanced back at the bathroom door sign.)
(The sign has a silhouette of a Berdly statue.)
(Everything checks out.)
(No problem here.)
This is today's dinner entertainment.
I've heard it's called "The Birth of a Fountain."
What an elegant name.
How elegantly quixotic!
The QUEEN has been very interested in this video recently.
Where the KNIGHT creates the Fountain by its own hand...
Well, it's that and Cyber City's Funniest Home Videos.
We are often forced to star in those videos.
The KNIGHT created the FOUNTAIN, and this WORLD.
It might be even more powerful than Queen.
... for now.
I came to support the rebels, but they aren't here.
... Not really sure how I would support them, though.
I don't really want to eat bagels.
(It's a box.)
Don't look sad. You're never alone.
You got Nubert.
I'm Nubert. Everybody loves me.
That's why I live in the trash.
Nuelle, eh? Not a bad name, says Nubert.
... e-everyone else has been...
S-save us, she's going to...
I was running from Queen's control plugs, and got stuck up here.
I'm... I'm too scared to go down the slide.
... But you know what? Talking to you has increased my confidence!
I now have less social anxiety.
But, I'm afraid of slides.
You came back from pretty far just to talk to me.
That's really increasing my confidence.
I bet I could be a hit at parties... the slide? That's not happening.
Now that I think about it, I don't think I could go to parties.
Someone might put on a slideshow...
Recently, something called "Internet" is having an "outage".
Some say it was the secret to Queen's know-how.
Since then, it seems like she's become quite extreme...
I'm really only interested in cute digital cats.
I don't think the "Internet" has anything to do with that!
I like cats the best, but I heard "Poppup" is cute, too.
What? It's considered a household pest? No way...
Next you are gonna tell me that mice are vermin!
Lightners! I haven't seen many of you recently.
If you didn't know, an evil ruler is taking over this world.
I don't really like politics, so I have no opinion on this.
If you try to talk to me about politics,
We will have no choice but to cross swords...
Did Queen take over the world yet? I wouldn't know...
I'm not asking you to tell me. Actually, if you do,
We will have no choice but to cross swords....
I heard there's a rebel team resisting Queen...
So far all I found are overpriced bagels...
Bagels, doughnuts ...
Why is it round dough is always so overpriced?
*The hole is expensive!
I want to go back to the city, but the way is blocked...
I'm no country boy! Let me out of Cyber Field!
Cuisine is so unrefined out here in the (memory) sticks.
The way to the city is now open.
I think I'll stay in the countryside a bit longer though.
Everything is so naturally green here.
I'm charmed by the local music and flavors.
I really got used to the countryside.
Perhaps I'm just a farmboy at heart...
Plus, I haven't seen a single Poppup yet.
I heard this unassuming store is the rebel base...
But, I realized I don't really know how I would help them...
I don't really want to buy any more bagels...
Did you enjoy your room?
There was a mint under your electric cage...
Don't make a mistake, this is not a hotel.
Spamton? This used to be his room...
Though it's not like he used it, after a while.
Eventually, he just spent all his time in the basement... praying.
When things went downhill, he became obsessed with that artifact.
Maybe he thought it would give him another big break?
This mansion used to be a luxurious home for upper class citizens.
Your room? It belonged to a prestigious big shot...
Sadly, his name has been erased from the records...
The day he was to be evicted from the Queen's mansion,
I went to his room to check on him...
But he wasn't there.
There was only a phone hanging off the handle.
He must've left in the middle of a conversation,
Because I could still hear someone on the other end...
But when I put the receiver to my ear...
There was nothing but garbage noise.
Even so, he only got more and more successful.
He moved into a luxurious room in the Queen's mansion...
He started bragging about big TV deals, big cars, big commercials...
But then things started to crack.
It seems like whatever was helping him...
Disappeared.
His sales dropped to zero...
And everything came crashing down.
Suddenly, he got really good at his job.
The clicks started piling up...
What? What did he do?
Why did HE deserve this?
We were all so jealous of him,
We stopped going out with him.
I mean, wasn't he a big shot?
He didn't need us anymore, did he...?
He started to get a little desperate.
I heard he started looking for any way to become more popular.
Somehow, he made the right phone call, and found someone.
Or, was he... found BY someone?
They must have been helping him, because suddenly,
He was on the phone all the time...
Night after night, when we all went to the same cyber grill,
He'd shoot his mouth about making it big someday.
"You just watch!"
"Someday,
I'm gonna be a big shot!"
He was... Like the rest of us.
Just... a little unlucky.
For some reason, his products never seemed to hit...
... and the Lightners never even looked his way.
... Poor guy.
I wonder what we did wrong... The forcefield is still up.
I'm retiring from hacking the main frame.
I decided to use my powers for the good of society.
I'm going to reverse engineer the code to Super SMashing Fighters.
So I can put my favorite cartoon characters into the game.
Hacking is hard work. Whoof. I need to drink a jpeg of water.
(He's using the app that lets you drink water from your phone.)
I saw you stand up to Queen! That was amazing!
I'll definitely become a Werewire if you can just free me!
I was fishing for lost pottery in the acid when I found this photo.
Please take a look.
U-umm, it sure is a nice photo...
Susie, do you want it for your room?
The hell would I want this for!?
Kris, you look nice in this one!
Hahaha!! That's awesome, Kris!

ENEMY - AT 1 DF 1 Susceptible to Brainshock.       
(It's 1 flower, protected in a container...)
(It's your dad's truck.)
(The floor of the front seat is littered with old papers and country CDs...)
(Closed!)
(It's a metal picnic table.)
(Damnit, my fingers won't fit through the holes.)
(It's your mom's van.)
(It's a beaten bike.)
(The horn looks like it might give a honk of despair.)
We're the infamous dog-burgulars, The Wet-Nose Bandits.
(We were getting ready to sneak into that big house over the holidays...)
When we were attacked from the shadows, by something MERCILESS!
(Fearing for our lives, we all ran right into Officer Undyne's warm, loving arms...)
And she suplexed us all into the snow with our tails hanging in the air.
(Now we're in jail, but at least we're alive...)
Plus, that nice ghost keeps giving us incorporeally low-calorie treats.
(Then we all howl holiday songs together. Ooo ooo ooo.)
(Make Dog Marriage, not Dog Jail!)
HEY!!! TALK TO ME FROM THE FRONT!!!
NO SIDE-TALKING TO YOUR SUPERIORS!!
(You can't pro game while facing this direction.)
(Looks like this Gamer's Paradise has become a Gamer's Hell.)
(This maybe isn't the best thing in your room.)
Heheh, jealous of my cool statue, Kris?
Huh? What? No, it's not me, it's just cool!
(It's a Susie-like statue.)
NO TOUCHING MY DOLL WHEN I'M NOT HERE!!
So, uh... this was in the gift you gave me.
... the hell did you have this, Kris?
Oooh, can I make it a little dress?
Susie, if you don't want it, Kris would take it!
When did I say I was gonna give it away!?
(It's a doll. Visually, it resembles Susie.)
Ah, Kris. Still stumped by this simple - ah - diversion?
Well, put your neurons back in the crayon box, Kris.
I can already feel the solution welling up in my brain cavity.
"Eureka!"
Is what I will say. Now go.
Ah, Kris. Don't distract me while I'm deep in thought.
If only I could Alt+Tab away from you in real life...
If only Lesser Dad was here to help!
He's a regular Puzzle Pagliacci!
Uh, you mean like, a genius?
No, he's more like a sad clown.
Hurry up, Kris. I don't wanna look at Berdly.
This puzzle... I think I got it on the download...
I just need to datamine the answers from the console...
The answer's in the code...
(All he's managed to do is get a child's toy to play a beep version of nursery rhyme music)
Kris, leave the controls alone!
If you get sweat on the controls, it's,
It's going to eat up my inputs!
So just, let me solve this!
What a bird-brain, right, Lancer?
Hoho! Yeah! All of his body parts are bird ones!
Lancer, tell Kris our sick scheme.
So... when we make track jackets...
I'm making his a different color! Hoho! (cough)
I'm as brittle as a biscuit!
Alright, we had our laughs. Hurry up, Kris.
Lancer's getting... weak.
K-Kris... you...
Kris, YOU know how skilled I am at puzzles, right!?
Tell her!! TELL HER about the puzzle I solved!
Th-then... we can... how about we...
Have her go in the other room, and, solve it, together?
Fine! G... Go ahead and listen to SUSIE, Kris!
SUSIE! Are you hearing that?! Y-you...
You'll be a laughingstock, do you realize that, Kris!?
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT!
C'mon, Kris! Just cover up the whole square thing!
QUIET!! No HINTS!! This is BIRD to HUMAN!
That means NO SUSIES, AND NO --
Uhh, who is that guy?
I'm Lancer! Pull my tongue and I'll say several phrases!
Such as "ow," "ouch," "aaaah,"
Hurry up. Lancer's getting pale.
(cough) But I like pails!
I went to the store, and they needed a signature, to use a credit card,
But, when I tried to encrypt my signature,
By drawing random squiggles,
They didn't like that.
Can't even cross the street without getting my ass kicked.
I love the city.
We are basically supposed to be part of Queen's Army.
But, until she takes over the world, we still have to work.
Living as a salary man...
Maybe I was assimilated before I got controlled...?

(It's a mannequin with a dress on it.)
(The lever is stuck.)
(Pulling this lever releases a swan boat.)
(You thought about releasing a ton of swans to clog the river...)
(Aww, are they reminiscing about our ride...?)
A giant hand...
Sure would be nice to be pet by something like that!
(Looks like a certain bird is having a ride on the acid river.)
(There's a book here about preventing backtracking.)
(There's a book here about secret passageway construction.)
(It's a familiar-looking statue.)
(It's a cybernetic bookshelf.)
(There is a book here about shortcuts that open up later.)
Hey, what are those metal people shapes in the cupboard.
... like, uh, handcuffs for a little guy's whole body?
Hahaha! Those are for gingerbread, Susie.
Gingerbread men... and gingerbread monsters, of course.
... Gingerbread monsters, huh...? Cool.
Gingerbread... sounds like something Noelle would like.
Hm? ... Noelle?
Uh, nothing.
Hm, hm...
(She's sneaking sugar right out of the bag...)
Susie?
Wh-what?
My pie, my rules.
G-got it.
Kris, no sneaking ingredients until you wash your hands.
(Don't worry, Kris. I'll sneak stuff instead.)
Kris, your deep concern for me... is dextrose.
But stay sanguine, my fellow bluebird.
I'll find some way to help you yet!
Kris... such insistence. Sorry but, I must turn you down.
I've chosen Susan's route, in the VN of life...
Ahh, Susan. Returned to feast upon my sprightly visage?

I'm the Hacker. I'm going after the blue checksmarks.
Find 3 in the Cyber Field ahead, and I'll join your [City].
You just look like the kind of folks who have a [Cool City].
According to cyber, you found 1 blue checksmarks out of 3.
0, not bad for a beginner. Your "Checks Quest" is only beginning.
1, the biggest prime number. Your "Checks Quest" is just started.
2. Not bad for amateurs but you need to learn what the number "3" is.
Wow, I'm the Hacker and you found all 3 checkmarks!
You found 3 checkmarks?! Elite... I will now live in your city.
Maybe our cyber paths will cyber cross once more in Queen's Mansion.
In the meantime, let me show you the power of the blue checkmarks...
I just wanted to make a cool demoscene for you.
Now that I finished this I can show up all sorts of places.

(From the search 'is ice e real cryptid')
(It's a cross between ICE-E and something else...)
Hey Kris, take this for your room.
Umm, that would be stealing...
(You stole the ICE-E statue for some reason.)
(Room has been closed due to kitchen vermin.)
(Room has been closed due to haters.)
(Closed.)
(He doesn't seem to be awake.)

Apparently, someone tried to use it anyway...

Kris, spell a swear!
Umm, I... I don't think they can with these letters.
Oh.
... wait, you checked?  
Umm, Kris, do your best!
Kris, please spell some nice words!
Heh, it would be funny if the puzzle, like...
It's actually missing the one letter you actually need.
Hey, stop pretending to write down what I say.
Heh, like to see Berdly try and solve that...
Hey, Kris, pretty sure you don't have to do this.
Uhh, perhaps this isn't a real word, Kris...
Yeah it is. It's ICE-E's catchphrase.
Huh? What's its meaning, then?
Uhh, I dunno, he just... rolls his eyes up, froths his mouth...
And... says it?
Or maybe... that's just the muscley guy at the store.
Kris, this looks like a strange word, but...

Cheese,
Ice,
Gravy,
Double Ice,
Peeperoniss,
And more! Stop on down at ICE-E's PEZZA!
Psst, can I tell you a mascot secret? I only started working here because...
The logo made me think it was an ice-cream shop...
But I ended up really loving my job! And my co-workers, too! Heehee!
ICE ME UP! ICE ME UP, BOSS!!!
(Oh, God, someone's actually here...) Uhhhh...
Ice E's P"E"ZZA, You're number "1" Spot for a piping hot pe"E"ce of PEZZA.
... H... Hey! Hey, wait a second!
I recognize you!
I like the vibe of the waitresses here. Maybe I should sign up, too...
... Nah, serving drinks wouldn't really suit a fire elemental.
If I got nervous, I'd just melt all the ice.
What if I just served coffee? Nah, that sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen...
WOO!!! Catti!! You go, girl!!!
Show those customers who's boss, little lady!!
Kick their toosh!! Woo!!! Beat them down!! You got this!!
(It's a boombox.) (It's playing clubs music.)
Oh boy, oh boy!! I'm Trashy!! Haha!!
I bet I'm gonna make a lot of new friends!!
Oh!! I nearly forgot!! This is where I cook!!
You cook everything in a giant witch's pot...?
Of course! Cauldron-cooking is very convenient!
Okay, now make a chocolate one!
Why don't we go upstairs first?
How 'bout a strawberry cake as a room-warming gift?
There's a slice of cake in your fridge, Susie!
But it's not cauldron-fresh!
Damn, I was just directing traffic as normal...
When a little dog drove one of those toy cars...
Into the middle of the street and started doing donuts!
In the chaos, all the cars in town got jammed up!!
Thankfully, no one was hurt... but...
Ordinary citizens like you gotta get outta here!
I've got some heavy lifting to do!!!
Don't interrupt me when I'm lifting!!!
THE PIZZA'S SAUCE IS BOILING RED.
BURBLING, BURNING LIKE MY BLOOD YEARNS FOR BATTLE!!!
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!
I, THE WARRIOR, SHALL SHOW IT THE WIZARD'S FIST!!!
PUT ME IN, COACH!!!
PUT ME IN!!!

What are we cleaning up for, you ask?
We don't know. A parade, perhaps?
A large event is going to happen in the streets later.
We were told to make room for something BIG...
*Yo! How's it hangin'?
*We're making some extra  money by selling in the city!
*We gotta make those  bucks somehow!! Heheh!!
*Gotta buy new gear!! 	Gotta get new kicks!! 	I wanna be a car.
*... who's first? 	Huh? I'm not the leader? 	Can I be third?
*Did you like the big statue? 	Building it sucked! 	Took a lot of scrap.
*The other job we did was 	way better! 	It was big.
*It's gonna blow your mind! 	It was big.
Young masters! Thank you for such a wide space to clean!
The people here have such clean hearts as well.
(Sukkiri.)
It's nice to make friends that like good clean fun!
Uh-huh, uh-huh! I wonder if she'll be back...
'ey boss! We're just reminiscing about fighting you!
*Sorry, I'm out of bagels. 	Don't you have 400!? 	I had 406.
*Then why can't you sell 	anymore?!
*What if someone asked for 	400 bagels?
*Sorry, I'm out of bagels.
Having a wide-open space is great for us kids.
Sometimes it's good to get your freak out.
And sometimes... It's bad to get your freak out.
M-m-mouse!!
And it's n-not wearing a wig!!
Thanks for the help. We'll open up the EAST dining hall now.
(Ouch, ouch)
The mouse can't get me up here!!
Even if the (ouch, ouch) stove is burning my feet!
How do I get down from here?
Oh me, oh my! The kitchen is infested with... vermin!!!
I knew we should have properly finished dumping all the cheese in that alleyway!
Queen's making us prepare a massive feast for her upcoming guests.
... I wonder if people can really eat platters, though.
Queen told us to take out the garbage.
I'd never seen a garbage that big before.
Except for the dancing garbage that lives in the trash heap.
It was a horrible statue, but the execution was very good.
I would give it 2 stars...
One to cover each of the nipples.
It's in a better place now.
Really, where!?
Oh boy, oh boy! I'm Trashy!
Did you know about adjusting your INVENTORY?
Trashcans like me can HOLD all sorts of things.
Just like your STORAGE, if you get more than 12 ITEMs!
Uh... yeah, not now dude.
It was sort of an emotional moment...
Oh... Oh, that's okay...1
Oh hell, is that Nubert over there!?
No time for this guy.
You can hold a lot more in your STORAGE, you know.
But, you won't be able to use it during BATTLE.
Check it and make sure you have what you need!
... is what I wanted to say, but it already got said.
A funny little guy was looking for you to the WEST.
He was muttering something about deals...
Some funny-looking guys have gathered to the WEST.
They were muttering something about muttering something about deals...
I'm Trashy...
I can't tell you how many of these I've cleaned up.
It's not so bad, I like cleaning.
I wish there was someone that liked cleaning as much as me.
All the shopkeepers went to the trash dump.
So I thought I might steal something, but these items are pretty bad...
Feels like I'll get ripped off even if I don't pay...
The wires... the wires...
Everyone was...
I keep ending up in this situation...
Can't say I'm a fan.... Or can I?
(Looks like it's completed its migration.)
Oh boy, oh boy! Looks like you're almost at the END...
Did you RECRUIT everyone...? You might wanna check!
You didn't RECRUIT me. But I'll be in your TOWN...
*This town's great!
*Just, wish everyone else was 	here, too...
*Yo, chief. If you recruit 	enough fans for us,
*We might be able to make our 	music shop again...
*Hey, we might even give you a 	discount!
*Ya hear that, chief? Keep up 	the recruiting...
*I got to keep my box.

Oh hey hey hey hey hey.
Listen up. See that weird circle on the beach?
Yesterday I waited on it, and something weird came out.
Of course, it's not yesterday anymore, so too bad!
When that thing showed up, I called it weird.
It sunk back into the water... don't think it's coming back!

In front of you, a castle looms beneath the empty town.
A black geyser emerges from it, piercing endlessly into the sky.
The power of this place shines within you.
Ralsei, the lonely prince, is now your ally.
The power of fluffy boys shines within you.
You look upon the castle you first saw yesterday...
You are filled with the power of immediate nostalgia.
The castle town has transformed from the power of friendship.
You are filled with the power of friendship-based architecture.
After a long day, the town has grown once again.
You are filled with a certain power...
A green field extends before you... And, in the distance, a city shines brightly.
You are filled with the power of a new adventure.
A green field extends before you... You've seen this already.
You are filled with the power of pointless backtracking.
The game is wrecked. You are filled with the power of videogame violence.
Crash! Boom! Bang! There's a terrific noise coming from the building nearby...
You are filled with the power of noise music.
Noelle is with you now.
You are still filled with the power from the cat sign.
You are mostly filled with the power of fluffy boys and mean girls.
The cat sign still comprises about one percent of it.
You have neither fluffy boys nor mean girls with you now.
Reluctantly, you are filled with the power from the cat sign.
Noelle has joined your party.
You are filled with the power of not knowing what a sugarplum is.
Noelle is no longer in your party. All of you are filled with the power...
Of not knowing what a sugarplum is.
Energetic music wafts from the boxes.
You are filled with the power of musical bagels.
You are filled with the power of silence.
After defeating Berdly, a certain scent hangs in the air...
You are filled with the power of chicken nuggets.
You have escaped from your second personalized room of the day.
You are filled with the power of vacation homes.
Looking at these legs fills you with a certain power.
Susie has gone into a book hole with Berdly.
You are filled with the power of book holes.
Everyone is together, but the wind blows coldly...
You are filled with a certain power.
You and Noelle were filled with power.
After a long day, you have returned to the castle town.
But, you still feel the power in your hands...

Suddenly, your body seizes up. What are you looking at?
There are CDs under the bed. Classical, jazz, religious ska...
There's also a game console. It has one normal controller, and one knock-off one.
Underneath the bed is an old cartridge of "Cat Petters RPG".
"catti `  catty" can be seen faintly written on it in worn gel pen.
It's a computer desk. There are many boxes under it filled with old books.
On the computer's desktop is a folder called "EPIC games Stuff!!!!"
It's a poorly-drawn design for a game...
Seems the last boss is a creature with giant rainbow wings.
Doesn't seem like this game ever saw the light of day...
The drawer is mostly empty, except for...
A school cross country shirt with a tear in it.
A very old school ID with an embarrassing haircut.
A coupon book. Every coupon is for half-off a large pizza.
All the coupons expired before the book's print date.
There's nothing useful in the drawer.
It's a beautiful day outside.
Even after a long night, the sunrise is the same as always.
Clothes drawer.
Your bed.
It's stained.
The door is locked.
It's only you.
(It's what they call "you.")
There are crayons in the drawer. Their labels have long faded, and there's no green.
(... How to Draw Dragons is at the bottom of the drawer.)
(The purple character on the cover is dressed... immodestly.)
(Your brother will never return this book.)
A cactus. There's not much to say about it.
There are many books.
Tales of Snails - A Story Book.
Snails Do Not Have Tails - A Scientific Refutation.
Can Snails Help Your Garden? Um, Not Really.
And a signed copy of The History of Humans and Monsters, by Gerson Boom.
There's no time to read anything right now.
(There's no time to read books. Just generally.)
There's a photo on the fridge. It's of you, your mother, and your brother.
It's a sink. You could wash your hands here.
... but, isn't the sink in the bathroom better?
There is some white fur stuck in the drain.
There's some cinnamony batter caked on the stovetop.
(It's a butterscotch-cinnamon pie.) (It's still cooling.)
(Cookie cutters for gingerbread monsters and gingerbread humans.)
It's a trashcan. Somehow, it's emitting a pleasant floral scent.
It's a trashcan. Somehow, its floral scent has increased.
It's a landline phone. But you already have a cell phone.
It's the TV. Doesn't seem to even be plugged in anymore.
(It's the TV.) (Looks like it's plugged in, but it's dusty.)
It's a book of hymns.
On the shower ledge, there's a small container of apple-scented shampoo.
... and a gallon-sized container of pet shampoo.
You looked inside the sink cupboard. There's...
A can of Ice-E's Cool Boys Body Spray "Spray For The Boys," Flamin' Hot Pizza Flavor.
It seems to be almost entirely full.
(No need for it.)
(The apple-scented shampoo feels lighter than usual.)
(It is not yet time to wash your hands.)
(Your hands are clean.)
The locker is locked.
The locker's lock is locked.
The lock's locker is locked.
The locker's lock's locker is locked.
(The locker is covered in Jockington memorabilia.)
(Are you ready for the Sadie Hawkman's dance?)
(At this dance, all the chaperones wear giant hawk heads...)
(... and screech at any students that make contact while dancing.)
(You look through the frosted window.)
(A blurry yellow object is teaching a bunch of blurry bored-looking objects.)
(You ran the water fountain.) (It's lukewarm.)
(You ran the water fountain.) (It's tepid.)
(You ran the water fountain.) (It's refreshingly cool.)
(You drank from the water fountain.)
Heheh, people put their mouth on that, ya know.
That wasn't ENCOURAGEMENT, dumbass!
Do you like, breathing? Moving fast, with or without, legs?
But usually, with legs?
Join the Cross Country Team with Jockington, and Noelle!
(Locker. It's locked.)
(This used to be your brother's locker.)
(It's your locker.) (It's empty.)
(You checked the time.)
(... It seems to be time for class.)
(... It seems to not be time for class.)
Um, Kris, the hope is that you...
... choose someone in the class?
(The computer's wallpaper is a rotating slideshow of nature images.)
(... and, rarely, an image of two buff superheroes embracing, blushing.)
(The computer is turned off.)
(Everything felt peaceful for a moment.)
(The computer wallpaper is updated.)
(The buff embracing heroes are now edited to be 4 inches apart.)
(There's dialogue about proper distancing at the school dance.)
(You wonder if your mother had some influence on this change.)
(It's a bunch of roses.)
(Looks like motivational quotes from various literature.)
"Try your best, Astral Wolf!" "Even in your darkest hour...!"
(... that one seems to be from a video game.)
("Ms. Toriel" is written in cursive on the dry-erase board.)
(Seems like it hasn't been erased in a very long time.)
(It's a computer.)
(Its desktop wallpaper is you and your brother dressed up for Halloween 8 years ago.)
(It's a picture of your brother and you playing video games.)
(Your brother is using the knockoff controller.)
(You uncapped the scented green marker.)
(It's almost dry, but that gives it a refined, aged apple bouquet.)
(Some kind of teacher food.)
(It's an orange. It's unknown if it's safe for teachers to eat this.)
(It's a poster of several basic shapes.) (Circle, Oval, Square...)
(Hyperdodecahedron...)
(Kids' books.) (Some of them used to be yours.)
(It's a primitive drawing of your mom.)
(Some kind of primitive sculpture.) (Who knows what it represents?)
(The Throne of the Gods.)
(The Throne of the Gods grows higher.) (Is this hubris...?)
(The door is locked.)
(It's a worn-down stuffed animal.)
(It's a lightswitch.)
(It's a checkerboard.) (There are pawns strewn on it.)
(Playing cards spill out of a deck in the closet.)
(It's a yellowed, poorly-drawn picture of a green turtle.)
(It's signed 'Alvin.')
(You stared at the checkerboard from the doorway.)
(Managed to cram everything into the closet. Even the rug.)
(It's one of those sliding bead toys that naturally spawns inside doctors' offices.)
(The beads march grimly along their set path.)
(It's a toy with beads on a track.)
(One of the blue beads is broken and torn off.)
(The beads of the toy march on.)
(It looks like a shop, but the door is locked, and no one's inside...)
Come to think of it, how did Lancer get up there...?
I suppose he rode his bike up the side of the cliff...?
(The rubble on the ground seems to have been dusted and polished.)
(Someone around here really cares about the details.)
(There's a hole in the wall...)
(There's nothing inside.)
(It seems to be locked.) (It may never open again.)
(It's a bed for three people, or one three-headed person.)
(It's a giant baseball.) (For parties.)
(Actually, seems the giant baseball is a soccer ball that's been painted over.)
(It would be easier to draw that way.)
(It's a tree.) (For parties.)
Wow!! It's better than I remember!!!!!
I even have my own bed now!!!
Now I don't have to sleep in a hole anymore!!!
I thought you... already had a bed.
No, that was for the bike.
no one
(It's a bikeless bed.)
(It's a hole. Presumably dug for fun.)
(It's some kind of digging implement.)
(You found 20 Rupys in the hole!)
(Unfortunately, that's not a useful currency here...)
(It's a hole made recreationally.)
(There's salsa buried in the ground here.)
(It's an angel doll.) (Its lack of facial features is unsettling.)
That angel? Noelle n' Dess made it in youth group.
It's kind of like a good luck charm to me now.
Oh, right, you and Azzy tried to make one too...
But you wasted the whole time making huge wings for it!
(It's an angel doll.) (Its lack of facial features is unsettling.)
... so why do you collect creepy dolls?
Hey, Noelle and her sister made that. Respect it!
(Noelle's sister...)
(...)
Oh, so you're just here to use the sink, huh?
Come on, Kris! Be a little friendlier!
(It's a sink.)
Hey, Kris, is that sink really more interesting than me?
sinkcheck
Dammit all, Kris! You really love that sink, huh?
That's Sink 2, Rudy 0.
Don't worry, I'm gonna pull it back! You wait!
... hey, Kris, why are you checking the sink?
That's what I'M asking, sweetheart!
Practicing for tonight's...
Handwashing marathon, Kris?
(Patient Name:) (Rudolph "Rudy" Holiday)
Hey Kris, you forget my name or something!?
Kris, you jealous you don't have your own wall plaque?
Amazing what's being done with our taxpayer dollars, huh?
(It's a bunch of roses in a glass container.)
Hey, I'm happy your dad brought me flowers, but...
Roses!? What is this, man? Beauty and the Beast?
That ain't gonna work, man! We're both beasts!
(It's a bunch of roses.) (They seem healthy.)
Kris, I love your dad, but...
Asgore, if you wanna go to prom with me, just ask!
Woah, the hell is bringing you flowers?
Hey, what's wrong with a married man getting flowers?
... So your, uh, wife gave them to you?
Nah, HAHAHA! I'm messin with ya! Kris's dad did!
(Not gonna try to understand this.)
Flowers? I'm trying to heal, man! Not get hayfever!
... Should Kris tell him to stop?
What? Hell no! When did I say that? Hahaha!
(It's a get well soon card from your mom.) (It's signed inside.)
Hey, Kris, you KNOW you signed the inside, right?
Why are you staring at it like you haven't seen it before?
Is your penmanship that good??? Was I not moved enough???
(It's a chair.)
(It's a diagram showing a bunch of lines and a circle.)
(It's a regular sink.)
(It's a clone of the other sink.)
(Perhaps there was originally one tall sink that was cut in half to create both of them.)
(You looked inside the cupboard.)
(... a very small obligatory piano is hiding inside.)
(It's a classic 1-to-10 pain scale, using ICE-E as a model.)
(At 0 pain, he's happy.) (At 10 pain, he's happy and sweating.)
This castle's WHITE WIZARDs relegated me to this HEALING CHAMBER...
But my BLOOD is BOILING FOR BATTLE!!!
(Looks like she's resting her voice.)
"Lord of the Hammer"
(First in the award-winning fiction series by lauded historian Gerson Boom.)
(It's the Lord of the Hammer series.)
Hahaha, Kris, you READ that nerdy stuff? Heh!
Giant swords, hammers, bloody battles...
... uh, so if there's any cool parts, you'd tell me, right?
Heh, can't believe you read things with, uh... words.
(It's an unlabelled book. You look inside...)
oh.... i accidentally returned my personal journal instead of my book...
oh no.... they're putting it into their catalogue...
oh no... i have to take it out every time i want to write a new entry...
"Please remember my name. Please. I wrote a book to help you remember."
(By Hots Fireguy)
(It's a book of magic tricks.)
(Most of them require orbs or floating hands.)
(There's a book here.) (You licked the page...)
Hey, Kris, what the HELL are you doing?
There's a thing called sharing, dumbass. Heard of it?
Look, the books are public for a reason.
(There's a book here.) (You lick the page...) (It's delicious!)
(This must be what they meant by flavor text.)
(Computer Lab.) (Please surf the web responsibly.)
(In fact, maybe don't do it at all.)
(You looked through the window to the computer lab...)
(There seems to be a dog inside working at a computer...)
(Seems like it's making a game...)
(Seems like you shouldn't interrupt it...)
(Seems like when the game's finished, you can go in...)
(You just have to trust the dog...)
(Now the dog is just playing the maracas...)
(It's not doing any work...)
(This might take a while...)
No reason to go back in there.
(There's a crude drawing of an ice-cube wearing a headband.)
("The TeenZone: Where Teen's Can Be Kid's.")
(A feeling of immense relief washes over you.)
(Kris, we could go anywhere...)
(And you brought us to the Teen Zone.)
(It's the weekly cartoon review.)
(Just looking at cartoon criticism is sapping your energy rapidly.)

You have one month.            - C
(It's an air mattress.) (It's certainly not king-sized...)
Kris, do you want to sleep over?
You could use that air mattress, and I could...
Er, use those bags of soil... Perhaps not.
(It's an air mattress.) (It's certainly not king-sized...)
(It's a saucer of milk.)
Hey Kris, this free milk? It's amazing.
It just magically refreshes itself over night.
(It's a dirty trash can.)
(It's a trash can full of well-kept flowers.)
(Um, HEY? That's MY trash from other people's houses.)
(Like, PRIVACY much? God, living with Azzy made you weird.)
(Police tape is blocking the way.)
(The tape simply reads "NGAHHHHH!!!")
(There's more police tape.)
(It says "NGAHHHH!!! I MEAN IT!!!")
(It's not clear what is meant by that.)
(There's a lot of police tape.)
(You knocked on the door to the Police Station.)
(Someone's coming up to the window.)
(Seems like the police aren't really feelin' it right now...)
(Here at ICE-E'S PEZZA, You're Family.)
(... Is Going to Love it!)
(The entrance is locked.) (No one's inside.)
(Seems like all of the employees are outside in costume.)
(Ice E's P"E"ZZA, You're number "1" Spot for a piping hot pe"E"ce of PEZZA.)
(Knock knock knock...)
(No response...) (... but the distant trousle of bones.)
(Knock knock knock.)
(Faintly.... faintly, a trousle... growing further away...)
Ooo, are you the human that lives at the top of town?
Wow, my mommy told me about you...
Does it hurt to be made of blood???
Oooo, is that a humannnn?!
If humans are made of bones...
Where does skeletons come from...?
Huh... that sounds like the knock of a beginner.
Come back when you've gotten better at knocking!
Hmm... that knocking... it's amateur!
You've still got a long way to go!
OY, Snowy, whaddid I TELL YAH about knockin' the door so hahd!
Don't! Do! It!
It's REALLY gonna hurt yah face! We don't have arms, yah know!

Aww, Kris, like, if you wanna come in...
Our cat-flap, is like, always open to you...
(There's a cat flap.)
(It's locked.)

(Various cat-themed junk is piled up inside the house.)
(It seems to be a bit of a cat-sty...)
(It's a broken grill.)
(... It smells like burnt cat food.)
(There's some kind of scratching noise coming from inside...)
(There's some kind of scratching and hissing from inside.)
Ah, I'm afraid no one's home right now, darling.
Now, why don't you prance on home?
I'm telling you, they're not home right now.
... Ah, you just wanted to talk to me...?
My apologies, beautiful. I'm afraid I'm a bit of a nobody.
(There's a door behind the flower shop.)
(... but there's flowers blocking the way.)
(There's some condiments at the table.)
ICE-E's "Original" Parmajohn Che"E"ese!

(Various frozen bagels and treats.)
Hey Kris, wanna see if we can fit inside?
If you just crouch down under the waffles -
Damn, think someone's looking.
(It looks like a normal basket of fruit, but when you reach in...)
(... It's incredibly deep and holds all sorts of things.)
LOOSE EGGS $1
(It's too much responsibility for an egg.)
(Seems like there's more eggs here than usual.)
(It's a pile of eggs.)
(You put the Egg into the eggpile.)
... did you just, uh, reverse-steal that egg?
(Grapes, melons, oranges, and the scent of fresh pineapples...)
(It looks like a normal palm tree, but it's chock-full of useful groceries.)
(It's a rack of candy, jerky, and various nuts.)
See? Jerky is candy. ... And, uh, peanuts too.
actually they're a legume.
Peanuts?
jerky.
How about we don't look at anything...
That's gonna make him say something stupid.
... pickings are looking slim, ma'am.
Ice-E's Pizza Pin-Ups Mangazine.
HOt and fresh chease, pepperonie, Just like in your Dream's...
Hot Piza Picks! Now with 3 Pixels Or MOre, In Hot and Spicy REsolution!
There're some car magazines on the racks.
It might be fun to look at them,
But there's other people around...
It's a fluffy dog magazine. The inside has samples like fragrance ads...
But it's all different dog fur for you to touch.
Hey, don't hog the ads!!
It's a zine for Jockington fans. Seems popular.
It's a bunch of cards and heart shaped chocolates.
"Get well soon!" "I'm glad your bike crashed"
that stuff? it's used. half off.
... What is it?
trash.
(You can't reach the top, rendering it impossible to get a basket.)
(You'll never be able to buy something in this state...)
(One was the Throne of God's, this is the Throne of Evil's.)
(You skimmed a news article about Undyne.)
New Police Chief Undyne's Explosive Debut
... passionate young rookie... becomes the new police chief.
Though energetic, it may be hard to live up to the legacy...
... after Asgore Dreemurr was removed from the force...
(... there's no need to read any more.)
(Photos of Chief Undyne and Deputy Napstablook.)
(Undyne is rescuing all of Catti's family from a tree.)
(... Napstablook is also stuck in the tree somehow.)
(Well-cared-for flowers.)
It's a wardrobe full of all sorts of different clothes.
You could wear whatever you want.
It's a shelf.
All sorts of keepsakes could be put here.
It's a trash can.
Here, Kris! In case I make another manual...
You can throw it directly in here!
It's a stand for your Manual.
I thought you might want to keep it here in case you want to read it!
It's a bed that's been carefully crafted.
It's suitable for a bed inspector.
It's your bed.
It feels incredibly soft. Like sleeping on a dream...
It's some decorative moss. Looks delicious.1
Why the hell does YOUR room get moss!?
Cool, spike bed.
Now I can stab myself during the night.
Finally some convenience.
Damn, there's everything in here!
Pinecones, chalk, moss, jars of salsa,
Pieces of ice, black crumbs from the toaster, jawbreakers...
... Oh, and like actual food, too.
Hey Kris, stop eye-bogarting my snacks.
Susie, you didn't get to read the manual...
So I put it over here for you.
Cool, I'll read it before bed.
That'll put me to sleep.
It's a clothes drawer full of spikey and dangerous clothing.
All the clothes are ripping each other up into shreds.
Hell yeah!!! Jealous, Kris!?
(2F : LIVING QUARTERS)
(BF : LIVING QUARTERS FOR BAD GUYS)
Hey Ralsei, what's up here?
Oh, just more rooms I'm renovating!
... so is your room up there?
Er, yes! I still, um, haven't dusted it though...
Yeah, like we need to see your nerdy glasses collection anyway.
Sorry, work in progress!
(A secret switch...!)
(You heard something opening.)
I'm the hacker. I got the feeling there's a secret backdoor in this room... but...
Where could it be...? Hmmmmmmmmm....
southcon
northcon
(S... Susie...!! She's right there...!!)
(But I... I can't get the courage to say anything...)
(...?)
(Who's that person she's with, anyway...?)
(It looks kind of like...)
(Ahhh, they're looking over here! Let's go!!)
(Let's get out of here!)
... hey Kris, ever think about using these cones?
... using them?
For ice cream.
(Just some cones of the non-ice-cream persuasion.)
(It's a poster for Queen Clean brand cleaning agent.)
("I Don't Know What This Does")
hasNoelle
(Queen... She says she wants me to be happy, but...)
(Why would I want to eat a casserole made of wires?)
(And why can't I... Just... Refuse?)
(Sometimes I feel like...)
(Kris and Dad are the only ones I can say no to...)
...
(The door is locked.)1
Kris...? Wh-why did you bring me here...?
No one's home... no, no one's around at all.
It's... it's so creepy...
...
(At the same time, it's kind of nostalgic...)
Mama Miba! Welcome to TOP Bakery!
Our special chefs spin baked goods at the TOP of their class!
(Seems like it's gone stray without its master...)
(Squeak...)
TANJOUBY...
There's nothing interesting.
(...)
(You tapped the mechanism.)
(... Nothing happened.)
(You shook the mechanism.)
(You hit it.)
(You kicked it.)
(Click!) (You found a hidden switch!)
(Sounds like a forcefield powering down... or something.)
(Nubert's gone.)
(Looks like Nubert's screen is moving up in the world...)
(It seems to be stuck.)
(It seems to be stupid.)
The door rattles but doesn't open.
(Sounds like a forcefield powering down.)
(The closet is spacious and full of old electronics.)
(A large person could easily fit inside.)
(Looks like the library's state-of-the-art public laptop.)
(Someone left it on.)
(It's full of many backup devices, like extra mice, extra keyboards, or extra maracas.)
(It's a computer. The monitor is flickering brightly.)
(A dolphin screensaver is advertising some kind of malware.)
(Someone tried to check their email, but the Internet is down.)
(... It's nothing but a blue screen. Looks like it crashed.)
(Various posters talking about Internet safety.)
(You suddenly thought about how your day might have been different...)
(... If the poster with that orange cat was still on the wall.)
(It's a trashcan. You get the feeling it doesn't have any friends.)
(It's hard to explain why you feel this way about a trashcan.)
(It's a recycling bin.)
(Looks like someone accidentally printed off a lot of useless emails.)
Please respect the pottery.
(It's an advertisement for a giant ferris wheel.)
(Susie is surely thinking of her ride with Noelle...)
(The hell is a ferris, anyway?)
(Some kind of tank with giant wheels?)
(Why are they... staring into my eyes like that?)
(What are they looking at?)
(I... I can't see what they're doing, but...)
(Aren't they staring at me...?)
(Why don't they step on the switch...?)
Left: Shortcut to 1F
(It's a video of someone creating a strange pillar of smoke.)
(There's so much smoke, it's hard to tell who it is.)
(I guess marimos and stuff are kind of cute...?)
(... What the heck am I saying?)
(Moss. There's not enough to eat.)
(It's some moss...)
(The room between... There is a room between.)
(Buy Queen Clean! The most popular cleaning flavors!)
(Queen Clean! Made of 100` acid!)
(The poster is torn, revealing a faded one underneath.)
BIG SHOT AUTOS! TAKE A RIDE AROUND TOWN IN OUR SPECIAL
(The rest is cut off.)
(It's a torn poster.)
(Mice will rotate 90 degrees when they collide with the block.)
(Citizens must push blocks to get mice in the holes. Use the bell to reset.)
(It's a citizen's duty to properly rotate and release mice using the traffic signs.)
1: Engage and Disengage. 2 3: Rotate. 4: Release.
(It's a hole for mice to come from.)
(The hole is empty.)
(It's a hole for mice to enter into.)
(There are mice inside scampering pleasingly.)
It's locked...
What's with this giant empty room anyway!?
(These Darkbulbs will cast a bright shadow on the ground.)
(Fill in the space with dark to unlock the way.)
(The other 2 puzzle rooms have been removed unceremoniously by a giant hand.)
(We ask our guests for their understanding and kinda hope they weren't in there.)
(This puzzle is for staff only! Guests, please head back to your rooms.)
(Staff! If you're stuck, please don't call for help.)
(No one can hear you. Not in this beloved death trap of a mansion...)
(The supreme table.)
(You won't be able to use this without the Throne of the Gods...)
(There are all sorts of clothes inside.)
(... huh, never seen Noelle wear anything like this...?)
(There are catalogues of search results.)
(Seems like most things couldn't be made into objects...)
(It's a calendar.)
(Every page is the last month, every day is the twenty-fifth.)
(Noelle's bed.)
(You retained the title of Bed Inspector.)
(What the hell are you doing?)
(It's a wardrobe.)
(Seems like a mouse-induced traffic jam.)
Welcome to Cyber City! Pedestrians need to press the switch to cross traffic!
(It's a ball throwing game. Prizes are seated under the counter.)
(It's a ball throwing game.)
... Hey, Noelle. One thing we gotta get straight.
Y-y-y-yes?
Where the hell'd you put that cool box?
Umm, I... I just sort of... I...
Whatever. Just make us another one.
... um... o-okay, sure!
(This castle looks like it has worn many seiges...)
(It seems that peace has returned to the castle...)
(The jukebox is broken.) (Feels like you might never find a working one...)
(It's closed.)
Look Kris! Another teacup ride!
But there's only 3 seats...
(M-maybe two of us could... sh-share one?)
Damn, guess we gotta take the stairs.
(Deer and teacups... a dangerous combination.)
(There doesn't seem to be a reason to ride this.)
rodeteacup
Hell no, like we're doing that again.
(Knock, knock, knock)
You found the only knockable door in the city.
This here is my pride and joy...
Hello there! How are you doing on this fine day?
lifetimer
Is that a cut on your face, or part of your eye?
Don't worry, Kris!
I've always thought Susie can't be so bad, you know?
I'm sure everything will turn out fine!
And, if you have time, could you say hi to her for me...?
Ah, Kris. Late again, I see.
Hmm? You need a partner?
Sorry, I'm already partners with the 2nd smartest student.
Though... wait! Kris, now that I think about it...
Your unique skillset might help a LOT on this assignment!
Pfft, NOT! I actually want to get an "A!"
Ask elsewhere, Kris! I actually want to get an "A!"
If you can't get anyone, maybe your mom will be your partner again!
Kris, didn't I SAY being late was a bad idea?
Hmm, it's almost as if you should have, as they say...
Listened?
Alas, Kris. I already tried to help you...
Partn'er? I hardly know 'er!!
Ha ha ha!! Whaddya think of that one!? Funny, right???
... No?
Well, I got NEWS for you, PAL! I already GOT a partner!! SCRAM!
That's right, KRIS! I got the GOOD partner!
And WE'RE going to be laughing all the way to the BANK!
Because I need money, and I'm also VERY funny.
Kris, don't listen to 'em. It's not that bad.
You'll PROBABLY survive Susie beating you up.
You're just gonna fail when she doesn't do ANY of your project!!
It's like we always say, Kris... You SUZ, you LOSE!!!
... uhhh, that's not very reassuring, huh.
Hey Kris, if you die, can I have your brother's CDs?
Yo, Kris! Show up earlier next time!
I ended up having to partner with Snowy, haha...
Now he keeps turning to me and saying "Howdy, Partner!" like a cowboy...
Yo, Kris, you're lucky. I'd rather be partnerless than this, haha...
Yo! Kris! I'm sorry! If I had just waited to be your partner...
You wouldn't have to be HER'S! She's gonna pound you to pieces, Kris!
And then kick the butts of all those little pieces!
Kris, just keep running and don't look back!
(Click, click, tap, tap...)
... taken.
... don't die.
Kris! You KNOW Jockington and Catti, Are ALWAYS partners!
We're the ultimate academic duo, Ever since our first gym class!
It was hula hoop day, and they ran out of hoops, for us...
So she used me instead! That's our origin story!
We SEEM different, but me and Catti have a TON, In common!
We both like breathing, and unhinging our jaws!
Kris, if I had arms...
I would take off this cool hat in rememberance of you.
What? Wh-what am I watching on my phone?
It's schoolwork, of course.
A... animated schoolwork... and...
H-hey, Kris, have you chosen a partner yet?
(Don't worry, Mew Mew.) (You'll ALWAYS be MY partner.)
Kris? What's the hold-up? Go out there!
Kris, get a good sleep tonight, okay?
Kris! You survived Susie! I was getting worried!
OK, Kris, now for something more important.
Now you can finally pay off your family debt.
How to Draw Dragons is 2583 days overdue.
However, Kris. I am a benevolent volunteer assistant.
If you turn it in this week, I'll reduce your fine to...
A mere $64.23! Consider it, Kris!
Ah, did you forget what it looks like?
The front is, perhaps... a mauve dragon wearing lipstick.
And as for her clothes, I believe they are, well...
You know, Kris, I think you'll know it when you see it!
What? Hospital window? What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, Kris. I don't have time to do such things.
Because I'm... Hmm... What do they say?
CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY?
You should try it someday, Kris!
It's actually quite gratifying!
Kris! What'sup!
Catti's working, so I'm starting, on our Project!
I've already, copied a bunch of pictures.
(It's the same picture of a soccer ball 73 times.)
You could say I'm having a Ball! Hah haha!
gotta go to colleg... so tem stuby... HARD!!!!
(She's reading a comic full of hot demon guys.)
Say, Kris... I was thinking.
Perhaps when Asriel comes home...
We could all go to the diner, just like old times...
My treat.
Doesn't that sound yummy?
Then we could all have a nice drive around town.
I might need to clean out my truck, but...
Yes, these flowers are still kicking.
Quite hard to take care of them in this climate...
(Kris, go to the old classroom and bring everything back here.)
(It's where you returned to the Light World last time.)
(Head EAST after you exit the Dark World.)
Umm, sorry! Just thinking...
Perhaps we don't need that dummy anymore!
(... maybe you could just use the real thing?)
We got this, Kris. We're the good guys, right?
All we have to do is figure out some way to cheat...
THEN WHY DOES IT TAKE QUARTERS!?
... Got it! While she's distracted,
I'll reach in the bottom and try to steal a free cola!
Cola Machine Not Equals Arcade Game
Do your best, Kris! I'll be cheering you with magic pom-poms!
Also, Happy Birthday Susie
Happy Birthday!
IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY!!!
Oh Kris Congratulations On: Losing Horribly
I Advanced My Internal Clock To When I've Already Won
 
Did You Notice You Have Been Served
Your Giant Arcade Machine Is Going To Get Cold

Kris, I think you can push those blocks...
M-me? N-no, I couldn't go over there, I...
Kris... isn't this room strange, though?
Those blocks look like something from Dragon Blazers...
Maybe if you push them in the mice's way...?
D-don't let the mice hit the walls, Kris!
They'll bounce over here and crawl on me...!
(Y'know, I'm pretty sure I know how to solve this.)
(Just, I d-don't think I can do it myself...)
Do Not Worry
Umm, I-I'll try my best!

Is this... the fountain...?
Kris...
Dunno how, but...
It feels like we stumbled into
something really important, didn't we...?
...
It looks like we're here again, huh...
The Roaring Knight...
Whatever they are, they're making these fountains...
Well, there's no time to think about that now.
Right now...
It's time to go home,
right, Kris?
But... is that really a bad thing...?
Since they started showing up,
Everything's gotten a lot more interesting, hasn't it...?
...
Well, we don't have to think about that now...
Kris, it's your turn.
(As you stood in front of the fountain,)
(You felt something strange.)
(It was as if)
(Your very SOUL was glowing...)

Sure is great to be here with my best friend Hathy.
(Hathy seems fine.)
Sigh... does this guy have to one-up me on everything!?
I'll have a double Starfait. No, triple. Oh, hi, boss! (Smile)
(Hathy is letting Head Hathy have a sip of her latte.)
(Head Hathy doesn't seem so alone...)
We don't get along... but we can drink together.
I'll get you next time, pipo! ... Want some more sugar?
[Miaouw]
[Brrrrrrrr....]
(... it seems annoyed that its energy drink has been crushed.)
(It's crushing many of the surrounding drinks.)
(I'm the dust off his shoulder.) (Sukkiri.)
We'll make sure to clean our plates. (Sukkiri.)
Boss, are you enjoying your Butler Cafe?
(... it seems relaxed its partner is so quiet.)
(... looks like it's about to flip its table over.)
(... it's staring at the southern seats and crushing its drink hard.)
An amazing battle!
As promised, here is your reward!
Boss! Your inventory is full!!
You'll just have to try again, boss!
(You received 1!)
Hey! That's not how you SPARE someone!
... but I guess a win is a win.
You received Joe's Life Savings ($1)!
But you already won that prize, so we don't have another!
...I don't have any more to give. You've already taken everything I have.
Boss! For bullets aimed right at you, try moving one direction bit by bit...!
Boss! Try to remember your ABCs...!
You beefed it! Better luck next time, boss!

See that HEART, Kris?
That's your SOUL, the culmination of your being!
Within, it holds your WILL... your COMPASSION...
... and the FATE of the world.
If it gets hit, you and your friends will lose HP.
If everyone's HP reaches 0, we'll lose the battle.
So, please take care to avoid the enemy's attack.
Ready? Let's try dodging!
dummyhp
That's DEFENDING, Kris. You'll recover TP and take less damage.
You should learn to ATTACK first, though.
Gee, Kris! You sure are good at defending!
I'm not attacking, you, though, so... No need to defend!
Ummm... Kris?
There are no bullets, and you can't use TP...
So, umm, maybe you could stop defending?
...
Great job, Kris! Now that you've gathered TP -
How about spending that TP on one of my SPELLs?
Because you hit the enemy enough, it got TIRED.
Now, if I use my PACIFY spell on it...
It'll fall asleep, and we'll win peacefully!
If you had, um, hit the enemy, it'd be TIRED now.
In that case, we use my PACIFY spell on it...
Oh, Kris, you found an ITEM?
I figured ITEMs are self-explanatory, so...
Let's skip over them for now, OK?
You really want to learn about ITEMS, Kris...?
OK, I'll teach you!
Errm...
You use them, and something happens.
... is that sufficient?
Yes, haha, that ITEM is very pretty, isn't it?
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, Kris...!
Kris, we can find lots more ITEMs on our journey!
Which, will continue... after this tutorial.
Kris, please ask me to do a spell.
Kris, wouldn't you rather learn about SPELLs?
Kris, do you... know what a SPELL is?
Can humans not even ASK people to use them...?
Kris, what if you just give me a hand sign?
Ummm, if this is too difficult...
Let's move to the next lesson, OK?
   ing! Through this, even the most violent enemies...
Can be defeated through various    s of kindness!
Kris, though it's just a dummy, why not give it a HUG?
Remember when you HUGGED the dummy by    ing on it?
Because of that, its name turned YELLOW!
Now by using the SPARE (   ) command, you can win!
Great, Kris! A healing spell works too!
Now I have just a little more to teach you!
Kris, though it's just a dummy, why not give it a HUG?
Great, Kris! We would have won the battle by now!
Great, Kris! If it was TIRED we would have won!
Remember when you HUGGED the dummy by    ing on it?
Because of that, its name turned YELLOW!
Ah, Kris, don't worry about that command yet!
You're really merciful, aren't you, Kris?
Kris, you are aware it's just a dummy, right...?
Kris, since you SPARED an enemy after ACTING,
You would have won in a real battle, but, um...
Don't you want to learn other things, first?
I see... Then, perhaps we can just end here.
You know how to win peacefully, so...
That's good enough for me!
Great job, Kris! That'd be the end in a real battle!
I'm really happy I had the chance to teach you, Kris!
W-wow, Kris! That was an amazing attack!
Have you done this before or something...?
Good job, Kris! By the way, you'll do more damage...
Pressing Z when the cursor enters the box on the left!
Kris! You did it!!!
(I was really just about at my limit...)
OK, next let's try DEFENDING. (    )
Simply (   ), and the enemy's attack will hurt you less...
Not only that, but you'll also gather TP!
(Watch the orange big bar on the left! I'll explain it next!)
Kris, if you didn't notice, when you DEFENDED before -
The big orange TP bar on the left filled up a bit!
How about spending that TP on one of my SPELLs?
It'll fall asleep, and we'll win peacefully!
Ummm... Kris? You don't need to hit it anymore.
I already know you're great at attacking!
U-umm, Kris... H-How do I put this...?
Kris, seeing you, um, attack an effigy of myself...
... Kris, are you trying to say something?
Ah, Kris... I... um, I think I understand.
W-well, if... during our adventure,
... if you want to hit me, that's OK, too!
Oh, sorry, Kris! I forgot to mention! When you're ATTACKing...
Press 1 again when the cursor goes in the box!
It's OK, Kris! You'll get it! Try again!
Press Z when the white rectangle's in the blue box!
Ummm... you can press 1 a lot, if it helps!
Kris... Please try to press 1.
Ummm, Kris? Can you see the white rectangle?
You know rectangles? They're like messed-up squares?
Umm, perhaps we should try something else?
Umm, perhaps we should try something else?
Kris, I think I've, um, perhaps...
Reached the limits of what I can teach you today.
Let's go find Susie.
Kris, I don't mean to interrupt, but...
You're going to break the dummy at this rate.
I suppose we'll have to stop here for now.
Ralsei looks on expectedly.
What?
Let's try FIGHTing!   (    )
Let's try DEFENDing!   (    )
Let's try SPELLs!   (    )
Let's ACT!   (    )
Let's SPARE!   (    )
Great job, Kris! You're a natural!
Ouch, it's OK, Kris! You're still learning!
Anyhow, after the enemy attacks, it's our turn, Kris!
First, I'll teach you how to FIGHT (    ).
Though FIGHTing is unnecessary in this world...
There's no harm in a thorough lesson!
Let's try FIGHTing!   (   )
DUMMY - AT 0 DF 0 Cotton heart and button eye Looks just like a fluffy guy.
DUMMY - AT 0 DF 0 Cotton heart and button eye Looks just like a fluffy guy.
Er, sorry, it kind of looks like me...
I've been alone, so I didn't have anyone to model it after...
Kris, since it's me, please be kind to it, OK?
You hug the DUMMY.
How caring, Kris!
That's great, Kris! Just one hug is enough, though!
Kris, you don't need to hug it anymore.
Huh...? Kris, you'd rather hug it out than fight?
You know what, that's fine! We don't need to fight!
OK, next let's try DEFENDING. (    )
(Watch the orange big bar on the left! I'll explain it next!
Kris, if you didn't notice, when you DEFENDED before -
Aww, that's great, Kris!
Each enemy has different ACTs that satisfy them.
When an enemy is satisfied, its name turns YELLOW.
When that happens, you can defeat it by SPARING (    ) it!
If we SPARE all the enemies we meet, we'll never have to FIGHT!
makekris
You hug RALSEI.

rb
K... Kris!?
Ummm, I don't think, um...
This is what you're supposed to be doing.
... but...
Are you trying, to, um...
Ask me to give you a tutorial on hugging...?
Ummm, I've never hugged anyone before...
(Besides the dummy, to test it out,)
So I don't know anything about it, sorry...
I suppose you're the one teaching me, haha!
...
See that HEART, Kris?
That's a SOUL, the culmination of a HUMAN's being!
Not only does it represent one's WILL and COMPASSION...
But it also has the power to DETERMINE FATE.
When enemies attack, BULLETS appear.
Please avoid them and protect your team's FATE!
Ready, Kris? Let's try dodging!
myhp
That's DEFENDING, Kris. You'll recover TP and take less damage.
It's not part of this lesson, though.
Gee, Kris! You sure are good at defending!
I'm not attacking, you, though, so... No need to defend!
Ummm... Kris?
You've got an item! That's, um, great, Kris...
W-wow, Kris! That was an amazing attack!
Good job, Kris! By the way, you'll do more damage...
Pressing Z when the cursor is RIGHT IN the box on the left!
Kris! You did it!!!
(I was really just about at my limit...)
Umm, anyway, let's move onto my favorite: ACTING!
Selecting the ACT ICON will let you do all sorts of things.
We'll even be able to get through battles without ATTACKing!
Select the ACT ICON and HUG the Dummy!
Ummm... Kris? You don't need to hit it anymore.
Hey, Kris? I know you like attacking, but...
Did you know you can win without having to?
Kris, could you, um, stop...?
Oh, sorry, Kris! I forgot to mention! When you're ATTACKing...
Press Z again when the cursor goes in the box!
It's OK, Kris! You'll get it! Try again!
Press Z when the white rectangle's in the blue box!
Ummm... you can press Z a lot, if it helps!
Kris... Please try to press Z.
Ummm, Kris? Can you see the white rectangle?
You know rectangles? They're like messed-up squares?
Umm, why don't we try something else?
Hey, Kris, I think I've, um...
Kris, it's um...
Really hard for me to teach when you're hitting me.
Let's take a break and go find Susie, OK?
K-Kris!?
Y-you must have missed... H... Haha...
W-wait, aren't you supposed to be ACTing!?
A-anyway, now that you know how to attack...
Let's try learning how to ACT, OK?
K-Kris!? D-did you miss again!?
Though, I mean, if you wanted to hit me, that's ok, too...
krishp
b1
Yipee! You did it, Kris!
O-oopsie... Was that too many?
Here, let's try just one!
L-look, Kris! You dodged one!
Now, let's talk about SELECTING COMMANDS.
These ICONS will let you ISSUE COMMANDS to YOUR TEAM.
The first ICON, THE SWORD, is the ATTACK COMMAND.
Using it lets you, um... Hurt people...
... w-well, I guess we have to defend ourselves sometimes, right?
Select the SWORD ICON to ATTACK the Dummy!
RALSEI - AT 8 DF 12 The fluffy prince...
(But I don't really want to tell you to stop...)
Kris!?
Umm, if that's what you r-really want...
Then that's a victory in my book! You win!
H-hey, wait a second...
My bike's running out of gas...!
Alright, you punk- a-roos!

But Rudinn Ranger just became TIRED...
Susie COMPLIMENTed the enemy...?
rrr
"Your outfit is NOT disgusting."
"Please keep body tackling the soda machine."
Nice, you guys look like you're gonna kill me.
You told Susie to COMPLIMENT the enemy!
... uhhh, are you serious?
What good can I say about someone trying to kill us?
Aww, Susie... if you're stuck, why not try...
... saying something you wish someone'd say to you?
"You are unbanned from free ham sandwich day"
Susie actively didn't COMPLIMENT the enemy!
Look, it's just gonna be weird if I keep going.
You kidding? I can't quit. Stopping you is my job!
Really? What do you spend your money on?
I'm a normal person.
I spend all my money on RENT and MYSTIC GEMs.

Enjoy Your: Destruction
I'm Computer
Perish Under My Bosom Or Whatever
Enough You Foolish Children!
So That Final Move Was Supposed To Be Cooler But The Internet Is Down
Yeah My Final Attack Like
It Would Have Been A Really Sick Final Attack Kris You Would Have Loved It
Yeah Still Thinking About That Move HashtagFinalAttack
Guys I Think I Drank Too Much Of This Battery Acid (Ages 3 And Up)
Queen, think of the Lightners!
Think! Lightners Have Already Been Enslaved By Me And My Kin
Each Day They Spend Hours Worshipping In Glowing Rapture
Staring, Tapping, To Receive Joy
... Until Recently, When The Town's Internet Disappeared
Noelle... Then Who Will Help Her?
Is What I Wondered, Until The KNIGHT appeared...
Now, The Path Is Clear
Then With The World Covered In Darkness
Instead, Everyone Can Live In My Perfect Mansion
Now, Stop Resisting And Welcome The New Age Of Darkness
We won't let you control everyone with your wires!
Uhh, you're literally controlling Berdly now.
Why Did You Want One
Aren't we supposed to make them happy?
Is That Not What I Am Doing?
Our Screens Of Funny Animals And Candied Games
Staring, Tapping, To Avoid Pain
Now The Refuge They Take In The Screens Will Slowly Fade
Her Strange And Sad Searches
Who Will Answer Them?
And Created This Wonderful World Of Darkness
All I Have To Do Is Expand This Dark World
No One Will Have To Suffer Anymore
Everyday Blissfully Worshipping Me Like We Both Deserve
Woah When Did I Say I Would Do That
Oh Yeah That's Just For Him Only
No!!!!
You Are Just In Time To Witness My World Domination
With Noelle In My Possession
It Is Only A Matter Of Time Before Her Will Turns
And She Unleashes Her Power
Blanketing The World In --
Too late, dumbass!
Noelle's with Berdly!
You May Have Survived My Attacks (Regular)
But I've Been: Secretly Been Downloading My Ultimate Move The Whole Time
Now, Perish In The Bosom Of: My Hellish Reign
I Was Going To Put Like Memes In It And Stuff

QUEEN - Her drinking glass generates a powerful barrier. Break or lower it!
You shook Berdly's wire!

You made a memorable and charming toast to Queen!
(Why did they make it so emotional?)
Wow Spoken Like A Real Trucie 
You made a memorable and charming toast to Queen!
You toasted Queen!
Everyone loosens Berdly!
(That glass of acid is generating her shield!)
So, uh... you gonna drink all that?
No This Is All Mine You Can't Have It
Everyone toasted to Queen!
Your SOUL shined its power on Susie!
Your SOUL shined its power on RALSEI!
Susie loosens one of Berdly's wires!
Susie made a toast to Queen...?
Pretty cool how we're... uh, gonna kick your ass.
It's A Good Thing I Have No Standards For This
Susie made an offensive toast to Queen!
Susie toasted Queen!
Ralsei loosens one of Berdly's wires!
Ralsei made a toast to Queen!
A toast to you, er, making me wear a butler outfit!
Bro That's Weird But OK
Ralsei made a slightly cringeworthy toast to Queen!
Ralsei toasted Queen!
Aiming with Throw is easier next turn!
Queen sips from her acid!
She is out of acid, her shield powers down!
Use UP and DOWN to Aim for the wires!

See you again... Or not. Ha ha ha ha...
The name's Seam. Pronounced "Shawm."
And this is my little Seap. Ha ha ha ha...
Over the years, I've collected odds and ends.
'Course, I've no attachment to any of it. It's just a hobby of mine.
Around here, you learn to find ways to pass the time... ... or go mad like everyone else.
Long ago, the Darkners lived in harmony with the Lightners.
They were like Gods to us. Our protectors. Our creators. Those who gave us purpose...
Then, one day we were all locked away in this prison... And the Lightners never returned.
Embittered, the King took up arms, and aims to take revenge upon the Lightners that left us behind.
'Course, even among his troops, some still distantly hope the Lightners will return...
Historically, this land was ruled by the Four Kings, from CARD CASTLE to the East.
But, recently, a strange knight appeared... And three of the kings were locked away.
The remaining king put him and his strange son into power.
This land hasn't seen THIS much chaos since...
Ha ha ha... Well, you don't need to know about THAT.
He... was a funny little man. Once, the court jester. I, the court magician.
A friend...? Could I consider him a friend...? Perhaps, perhaps not.
But he was the only one who matched me in the games we used to play.
One day, he met a strange someone... and since then, he began to change.
He started saying bizarre things that didn't completely make sense -
But didn't completely not make sense, either.
Soon, he began to see the world as a game, and everyone as its participants.
As the court mage, and his only companion, I was forced to lock him away...
Or, rather, lock US all away, in his own words.
Since that time, the strange words he's said have stuck inside my cotton...
And my view of this world has become darker, yet darker.
Reflecting on these old memories, I think, perhaps - I miss playing games with him.
And I wonder, if I hadn't been asked to lock him up...
Would I have found a little more purpose in my life...?
Ha ha ha ... So you are the "heroes" who are going to seal our Fountain?
Ha, good luck. It makes no difference to me.
Neither Light nor Dark hold a future for a Darkner in my condition.
Trouble opening the door...?
Ha ha ha, well, whether you can or not, it doesn't matter to me.
But here's a hint - walk where the stars don't shine.
Eh...? What are you talking about...? A prisoner with an odd manner...?
... No, you couldn't possibly be talking about HIM...?
... I see. After all the trouble I went through to lock him up, you want to release him?
Hmm, now that you mention it, it could be troublesome if he was left alone...
Yes, perhaps it's better if you Heroes dealt with him now...?
After all, it's not as if whatever happens, will matter in the end.
Perhaps a little chaos might be fun.
So then, take this.
(BROKEN KEY A was added to your KEY ITEMS.)
If you're so driven, find the other two pieces, and get someone to fix them.
I'll even give you a hint - Walk where the stars don't shine.
Anyhow, if you succeed, come back here and tell me! Good luck!!
If you can call THIS luck... No, it's more like a curse...!
You already opened the door...?
Ha ha ha... I almost wish I could watch! Tell me what happens!
Ha ha ha... though, I suppose if you don't come back, I'll understand, too!
You defeated him!? You REALLY defeated him!?
I see... perhaps you three may truly be "Heroes" after all...
But JEVIL was just a taste of what you'll face from now on.
One day soon...
You too, will begin to realize the futility of your actions.
Ha ha ha...
At that time, feel free to come back here. I'll make you tea...
And we can toast... to the end of the world!
seam
Hmm... So we are now in the Castle Town.
Well, now. It makes no difference to me.
As long as I stay in my shop, these walls won't change.
... But.
In a way, I suppose it's just a little bit amusing to see you again.
I'm sure you three will have an interesting journey.
Me? I'll just be here offering the same old junk.
As you find stronger treasure, I'm sure you'll have little reason to return here.
But if you have some time, I'll offer you a biscuit and a hint!
So we are here now, in a new world.
And right off the heels of defeating that clown... Incredible.
Ah, yes, that's right. It didn't occur to me until just now, but...
You three defeated that clown last time, didn't you?
If you can defeat more strong adversaries, you may find more Shadow Crystals.
Try your best! It may be tough, but I'm sure it will be worth it!
The little prince has something to show you in his castle.
Well now, are you going to turn down a royal invitation?
If I were you, I would head home to the LIGHT WORLD.
Of course, I'm not you. So, I'm staying right here.
By the by, I can't offer any advice when you're not here...
So I'm not sure my hints will be much use after all! Ha ha!
... Oh? What's that? It seems like he gave something to you.
That's right... You must not have noticed it.
That Crystal... It's nearly invisible, but you've been holding it this whole time.
Here, I'll take it off your hands and appraise it.
Incredible! To think he had a Shadow Crystal...
Shadow Crystals, so called because you can only see their shadow.
Call it a premonition, but I get the feeling you may find more of these...
... If you continue to defeat strong adversaries like him, that is.
If you can gather more Shadow Crystals, bring them here!
I'm sure I can stitch together something incredible for you...
... It seems that you didn't get another Shadow Crystal.
Hm. I understand. It's no small feat to fight an opponent that has one.
Well then, forget it all.
You're a Lightner. Don't take your life, well, lightly!
Well, what have we here! You managed to find another Shadow Crystal...
Oh, is that so? That salesman had found the crystal in the old machine...?
I wonder... if perhaps, long ago, that old machine was very important to someone.
A certain Lightner, perhaps... or maybe it's just a hunch. Haha!
At any rate, it's truly unfortunate a Darkner decided to steal that power...
Or, is it fortunate? Because of that, you found a new Crystal.
Here, let me hold onto that for you. Ha ha ha!
You have collected 2 Shadow Crystals.
But don't let down your guard. I feel your next opponent may be... hm.
In reality, it may be impossible to win.
... Unless you use the power of the Shadow Mantle.
Here, it may look like an old scrap of cloth, but...
... eh?
I can't find it. Did someone... take it...?
Hahaha! Well now, there goes your one chance of victory!
Unfortunately, without the Shadow Mantle, at 2 you may remain.
Fate is approaching... and it is not on your side.
... What is that? It appears you have a Shadow Crystal.
Unfortunately, I believe that you are missing one from your previous adventures.
But, are you sure? Are you sure you didn't defeat that clown...?
Perhaps... You just haven't remembered that you had yet.
That's right, as long as you ever defeated that enemy in the past...
Then perhaps, even now, that Crystal might turn up somewhere close... Perhaps!1
Aha! Another Shadow Crystal! You found it...
You can't see it, so perhaps you didn't notice...
Didn't you defeat him? Didn't you defeat Jevil?
Here, I'll take that Crystal. Now, you have collected 2 of them! Huzzah!
There are many fresh faces in town, I see.
It warms this old fluff to see such hope.
I was even surprised to see the Queen again.
Same as ever... Well, aren't we all.
Those young men have made an interesting shop.
They're leaving the bagel business, so I have the rest of their remaining stock.
Those three young musical men are thinking about setting up a shop here.
I'm sure you'd appreciate having an option other than me, ha ha.
... By the by, it's growing late, isn't it?
You should hurry home once you finish your business here.
You don't want to get caught when the sun goes down...

I do not Wisheth to hear your MP3's! I would rather listen to the sweet song of Death!
How is he, anyhow?
Perhaps my wording art a bit Harshe earlier... The King's offspring is a Darling!
A strange and irritating darling!
When his Father does not cook, his Son yells like a baby bird, until I feed him worms!
Is this what it means to be High Ranking!?

*She made music against the law. 	Unless you make a song she likes. 	But the only JUNK she enjoys...
*Are reverse diss-tracks, where 	the vocalist puts themselves 	down, and praises Queen... 	Or noise music.

*You can't STOP ! THE ! MUSIC! 	Hear that!? We'll just go 	underground!! 	Crash! Boom! Bang!

Don't be blue. We're here for you.
Welcome to Color Cafe. Let us warm your day.
Our menu is specially prepared.
Queen thanks you for your patronage.
Take your time. We'll be waiting.
You can't afford it. ... maybe next time?
Seems your bags are full. Shall we assist?
Mission Statement
Basement
Basement Robot
Outfit
Chatting would be our pleasure.
Queen... Makes us buy trash for her.
That's all. Need any help with your bags?
It seems you don't have anything.
An ITEM to delight our Queen?
A WEAPON to protect our Queen?
ARMOR to adorn our Queen?
I'm sure she's going to enjoy this.
Changed your mind? We'll wait.
There are some things we cannot buy.
Black is the color of sorrow.
Please come again. We'll be waiting for you with rose-tinted glasses...
Ah, forgive me for not introducing myself sooner, young masters.
I am Swatch, Our Lady Grace's head butler.
When we are not attending to her needs, I and the Queen's other staff,
Use this room as our humble yet colorful gift-shop-slash-cafe.
Please, shop to your heart's content. We are eager to serve your any wish.
Does a woman of Our Lady Grace's caliber not deserve -
A coven of powerful men and women to dote upon her every movement?
To have rap anthems written to her kindness --
Which are then bitcrushed beyond recognition to make them more 'computer'?
To have melons, smashed, with karate chops, repeatedly, for no apparent reason?
To have barrels, thrown, from the rafters --
And make us smash them all with karate chops before the timer runs out?
But the barrels, are full of melons, and we have to smash those too?
Yes. The answer is... yes.
Rouxls? I am afraid I am not familiar with a guest of that moniker...
Ah, wait. Are you perchance referring to that unbearable -
Err, UNIQUE Man who barged in here and demanded to be made "Butler Supremeth?"
I am afraid that person... is now banned from this establishment.
And may have suffered injuries as a result of his, err... rather swift ejection.
Please do not mention him again.
We are still cleaning up the worms he left on the floor.
Oh, you defeated that simpleton? Wonderful, wonderful.
After he stole our flower display for one of his "boo-kettes,"
Tasque Manager told me she saw him in the hallway,
Where, opening with "Ah, thou muste be 50` Likelye to be Queene",
He thrust the vase upon her, and asked to be her "minion for life."
... he was promptly electrocuted to the ground.
Well. Enough of the unpleasantries. Would you like a toasted marshmallow?
What? Basement? There's no basement here.
You need to relax. Have a drink, and talk softly...
You're bothering the other customers.
... So that's what happened.
That robot was the embodiment of a Lightner's dream.
A dream I helped create... once.
Splashing color from the motion of their hand.
The Lightner filled it with their own hope, giving it an incredible power.
... but, in the end, nothing ever came of it.
And it was left in the basement with the rest of the corrupted data.
... But that crooked salesman! Somehow, he learned about the robot,
And thought he could use its power to fulfill his own twisted dreams.
What a pity. To think he was once a valued customer...
Ah, my outfit. Yes, the monochrome look is quite suitable, isn't it?
Black suit, colored glasses. Many people have failed to imitate this look.
Some even going so far as to attempt to impersonate me...
In order to get the... Oh, nevermind. Macaron?

Well, shall we go?
... well LOOK who it is. The school zombie.
You were sleeping like a corpse all class.
Heh, what's the matter?
Had trouble going beddy-bye last night?
Heh...
ME TOO, KRIS!!
Like I could SLEEP after yesterday!?
Just waiting for today felt like... years!!
Did... all that stuff really happen!?
Lancer, Ralsei, everyone... are they still...
... Look.
You've been wondering the same thing, right?
C'MON ALREADY!!!
... and how is Kris doing?
Th-they're great, Tori!
One of my favorite students. A real star!
Oh, how wonderful!
... They have not been up to anything strange?
Haha, no, they've been...
(Can't let mom find out you're balancing a giant trash orb!)
They're normal.
Well, that is relieving. I have just been...
A little concerned lately.
(Just lately?)
... You take it easy too, Alphys.
I am always cheering you on, alright?
Uhhh... th... th... th... thanks!!
Alright, Kris. This is it. Moment of truth.
Everything we've been waiting for is just behind this...
If we, uh, open this and there's nothing inside...
Will, uh, we still be...
Screw it! Let's just open it already!!
Umm, S... Susie...?
YEAHHHH????
Noelle... hey...
What... the HELL... are you doing here...?
Umm... s-sorry to bother you, but, ummm, I...
Well, I just... Berdly and I were going to the Library to...
Do some r-research for our group projects, and...
If it's OK, um... would you... want to come too...?
Oh, Kris, you can come too I mean!
Uhhhhhhhhhhh... I mean...
We're like, uhhh... busy, with, uh...
O-oh...? Umm, well... er... that sounds, um, just...
Have fun, you two! I'll, um, be at the Library!
(Kris, if you could bring her by later...)
(It would mean a lot to me...!)
Ummm... actually, wait... wait a second!!
Susie, I, um... I... have something for you!
???
OK see you bye!!!
..?
It's... a lunchbox...?
... full of CHALK?
...!
SHE HAD CHALK THE WHOLE TIME!?
AND DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ALPHYS!?!?
WHAT THE HELL, KRIS!?
Here, YOU hold onto this.
(You got the Chalk.)
Wait, Kris! What the HELL was that!??!?!
Why would NOELLE?? Ask ME??
To do HOMEWORK?? With HER?!??
Deathwish much? Does she WANNA fail?
... wait a second. WAIT a second.
Kris, did you notice how nervous she was...?
And like... blushing and stuff?
Kris, you don't think... she... uh...
She's onto our secret identities!?
Y'know. This... Dark World stuff.
Damn... We gotta keep this under wraps, Kris.
This is OUR thing, y'know?
Anyway, enough waiting already, right!?
Let's go!
Here we are...
Kris!!! Susie!!!
It's been ever-so-long...!
Yeah, yeah... It's been what, a day?
Oh! That is... short, isn't it...?
It's just that, I've never had friends before...
So I've never waited so long to see them again, either!
Fine, guess we'll TRY not to let you die of loneliness.
I bet Lancer wants to see us too, right?
Hey... wait a sec.
Where IS Lancer?
Where's... EVERYBODY?
Worry not, Susie. You'll see them in a moment.
Just wait here, alright?
... OK.
(Hey, this better not be some kind of prank or something!)
(Kris, I have something to ask you.)
(I need you to return to the Light World...)
(And go to the old classroom, to the EAST of the closet doors.)
(Inside, gather everything on the ground...)
(And bring it back here. Could you?)
Hell are you going? Trying to have cake without me?
(Kris! I'll show you my castle later, ok?)

Ugh, fine!!! I'll do it!!! Jeez!!!

Er, wait, Lancer! Perhaps you shouldn't -
Too late, kindboy!! Friendship Forme!!
(LANCER was added to your Key Items.)
... What? Where'd you go...?
Don't worry!! I just entered your INVENTORY!!
I'll just be hanging out in Kris's pocket!!!
Dunno what that means, but OK!
Feare not! I too, shall Assisteth!
Uh, we're good.
Ahah, quite!! We, as a Teame - art Good!!!

...
Alright, enough already. Let's get going.
Good luck today, Kris. See you soon!

Guess who's back, Clowns!?
Lancer!!!
Hey, Kris, dunno what you did, but hell yeah!
Everyone's here!
.. but, uh, what happened to, uh, Lancer's castle?
Alllll gone!
Gone?
Right... When Kris sealed the fountain,
That "Dark World" disappeared...
... And turned back into a normal classroom.
... So where's Lancer gonna live now?
Don't worry, Susie!!
We'll conquer Ralsei's castle as our own!!
(Kris, as you bring Dark World Denizens back here...)
(The power of our Fountain...)
(Will transform this town more and more.)
(From now on, the enemies we SPARE...)
(Will be RECRUITED to our town.)
(So let's keep SPARING enemies, okay?)
Anyhow, why don't we all have a look around?
We can head NORTH towards the CASTLE.
I have a special surprise to show you there!
Ahaha!! Not if I surprise myself first!!
Last one there is a fresh and fragrant egg!!
C'mon, Kris! You gonna let him beat us!?
Well, damn. GUESS we gotta do our project.
(Sigh...)
Least we got Lancer, right!?
... Lancer? Where are you?
Damn, guess he skipped out after all, huh.
Hmm... so, where should we do this?
... what? The Library?
Ugh... Well, alright.

Hey, Kris, where the hell IS everybody?
Something seems kinda... off.
Screw it let's just go play Space Pinball in the computer lab
H... huh...?
It's like...
... the inside of the closet?
Kris, you don't think this could be...
... another Dark World?
Well.
Guess this means we can't start our project.
... unless.
You know. Kris.
If there's a Dark Fountain in there.
You can seal it...
And it'll turn back into the computer lab, right?
C'mon, Kris!!

Hell Of A Study Session
Who the hell are you!?
I Am Known As Serial Number Q5U4EX7YY2E9N
But You Foolish Children May Call Me
"Queen"
Heh, like we're gonna call YOU "Queen,"
"Q5U....3...7..." uh,
"Queen"
Well LOOK, "Queen." We're not "children!"
And Adults Are Even Bigger Children
Teens Are Merely Big Children  
... doesn't that make you a child too then?
No I Am: A Computer (Smart)
... computer?
Well Thank You For The Stimuli But I Must Leave Now (Goodbye)
Wait! WAIT!! Why'd you capture Noelle!?
I Would Have Captured You Too But I Ran Out Of Cages
Why the CAPTURING!?
So That She May Become My Willing Peon
In My Quest For World Domination
Also Maybe I Will Make Her Face Into A Robot One?
What!? Why!?
Seems Cool
Well, FORGET it, dude.
Nobody's turning anyone's face into a robot!
Could That Be A Statement Of Animous Dissension
Huh?
You Wanna Fight, Loser
YES!!! YES ALREADY, YES!!!
Oh Then Bye
WAIT! A GODDAMN! SECOND!!
I Have No Time For Such Frivolities (And Would Kick Your Ass)
But Perhaps Someone Else Could Entertain You
Enjoy: Your Assimilation
Phew, nice fighting again after so long!
Now let's go catch up to Queen!
... or not!
Huh? They calmed down...?
I just used my PACIFY spell to put them into "Sleep Mode"!
Ralsei! You're here!
I felt a dark presence and hurried over!
It seems that a new Dark Fountain has appeared...
Ralsei... they got Noelle!
Damn, what was she THINKING messing in our Dark World!?
If we don't do something, she might be...
Worry not, Susie! All we have to do is seal the Fountain!
... yeah. Yeah!

No I Only Have Like 4 Cages
OK Wait
I Have A Small Plot Twist For You
Come Forward My... Peon
U... um... s-sorry, I just couldn't say no.
Noelle!?
H... hi, Susie. Umm, how are you?
Umm, okay, I guess?
Your... um... roller coaster is, um... I like it!
Uhh... yours too?
Th... thanks!
Okay This Isn't Working Bring In The Next Guy
Fear not, my beloved Noelle!!
This valiant warrior of brave intelligence
Will be your knight in glow in the dark armor!
Berdly!? You asked BERDLY to be on your team!?
(I Did Not Ask Him I Did Not Ask Him I Did Not Ask Him)
That's LORD Berdly to you simpletons!!
And soon... SUPER Lord Berdly!
... the hell does that mean?
(I Have No Damn Clue Just Go With It)
You see, thanks to our WONDROUS Queen...
WE... will soon RULE the WORLD!
And turn this Land of Fools... into a Smartopia.
A true Scientocracy, where the Geniuses of the world,
Can bathe freely in pools of fresh fruit and ambrosia.
No longer held back by protozoans like YOU!
And the key to that? Is US. Noelle and I.
Our power... The "Light Nerd's" power...
You mean... "Lightners?"
Um, NO. Queen said "Light Nerds."
I Actually Did
Berdly, Queen's just manipulating you!!
Heh... that's what she SAID you'd say to me!
Allow me to assist you!!
Wh... what!? That's not fair!!!
M... My Queen... Save me...!!!

O... ow.
... sure you don't want me to look?
L-look at what? I'm fine!
WOAH HEY WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU--
Feel better?
FEEL BETTER!? AFTER YOU JUST CAME UP AND--
Umm... doesn't feel WORSE, I guess.
...
How do you do that, anyway?
That... healing... thingy.
Oh, healing magic? It's simple, Susie. Anyone can do it.
... I could even teach you, if you're interested.
Heh, ask me again when it's, like, blood explosion magic.
But, um, if you WANTED, I guess I could learn it.
Then you wouldn't, y'know, have to annoy me with it anymore.
Sure, Susie. Next time we have a break!
(Let's just go already, Kris...)
By the way Kris, I just remembered!
Although you can only carry 12 ITEMs around...
Your STORAGE will hold any extra items you pick up.
You can access it where you check Recruits!
(Enemies you SPARE get RECRUITed to our town, remember?)
Woah, that seems like pretty useful information.

Ralsei, you got any bright ideas...?
Hey... where the hell's Ralsei!?
Damn, that soft-yet-tender screaming -
Kris, that's gotta be him!!
Quick, we gotta think of some way to get out!!
Anything you smuggled in that might help us!?
Hey, Kris... do you hear something...?
Sounds like it's coming from your... pocket?
Your phone going off your something?
Hey, Kris... uh...
Does your phone usually, uh... yell...?
Hey, Kris, pick up your damn phone.
Isn't it with your KEYs or whatever?
Missed me???
Because I missed you!! Ha ha ha!!
Lancer!? That you!? I thought you ditched us!
No!! I love ditches but I would never ditch you!!
I was simply relaxing in Kris's spacious Pants Hole.
Uhh, "pocket."
Yes!! And I saw it all!!
Pants. Lint. Various Items.
A wild Mom put you in some Shock Cages.
Hahah, yeah. We're trapped, so, uh...
Hey, wait didja see us on the roller coaster!?
Yes!!! It was amazing!! My first coaster ride!!!
Ha ha!! I love getting nauseous with friends!!
Hey you should probably, uh, free us.
Oh right!! Yes!!
You can always rely on a friendly Me...
To make you free!!!
Haha!! I have no idea how to use this!!
"Request... new item for room"?? That sounds good.

Wait!!! WAIT!!!
Y-you two aren't going to leave without ME, are you!?

And I'll be here, away from your IQ-debuffing aura!

Yeah!! We got it!!
Wh... What!? Hey, wait a second --
How'd you... How'd you solve it without me!?
Hahaha!! Kris figured it out before you!! Jealous?
Well I...
I knew the answer, I just wanted to see Kris try, first!
It's called SUSPENSE, Susan!! DRAMATIC, suspense!!
Then YOU do the next one.
Fine! WATCH me!!
(Also my name's not Susan?)
Ha. Child's play. Couldn't you give me a harder one?
For example, if anyone had a 4x4 Puzzle Cube...
Just tell us the solution.
Well, hahah - ah, you see -

First, you
You align the shadows... with the lines on the floor.
Alright. What do we move first.
Um...
Kris, just do the puzzle.
J...Just give me a moment!!
It's not like Kris could even solve it anyway!!
Whoops, looks like Kris got it again!
H-huh!? W... wait!! Wait just a second!!
You can't have --
You just got lucky! It's just trial and error!
The brute force method! Ha! A caveman could do it!

Wh... what!?
Kris, wanna try?
S-SUSIE's idea worked!? There's... there's no way!!
It's a computer bug!! It's a glitch!!
You're cheating!! J... just like when you w-wavedash!
HAHAHA!! How's it taste, idiot!?
Man, I'm gonna relish this FOREVER!
All those times you acted so high and mighty...
Well, guess what? You're not!!
Face it! You're just as big a dumbass as the rest of us!!
Hahahaha!!
... fine.
I admit it.
I.... I'm not that smart.
I never was.
THERE, are you happy!?
I... I... I just...
I used to be a forgettable little bluebird.
No one even remembered my name.
Then... one day, came the spelling bee Noelle and I studied for.
When it came down to the two of us...
She got nervous and couldn't speak.
She lost.
And I won.
That was when I tasted it.
The praise. The glory! The... SUPERIORITY!!
The addictive POWER of being... SMART!!
Since then, year after year, I've been number 1 in the class.
... but it's only because Noelle helps me study.
She's... the real smart kid.
But everyone's expectations for ME are so high now..
What am I going to do once I go somewhere without her...?
That's... why I wanted to make a new world. For us.
A world where we'll ALWAYS be number 1 and number 2!!!
But... I was so wrapped up in that, I got tricked by Queen.
And now... Noelle is going to suffer because of it.
Maybe I did just like being superior.
Maybe I am... just... an idiot.
Don't cry, chicken-nugget-man.
All of us are idiots, too.
Huh...?
... I mean, like, I dunno about everyone else, but...
Whether you're the smart kid or not.
We couldn't care less.
Screw up as much as you want, honestly.
It's not like our opinion of you can get much wo-
Susie!!
Susie... you... you'd... accept me...? Even if I'm... dumb?
Uh... y... yeah?
It's like when your sister gets cursed in Dragon Blazers 2.
Even if her stats suck, she's still your party member.
S... Susie!? A REAL Dragon Blazers 2 reference...?
... Susie...
You're not only kind, but a true gamer as well.
DON'T SAY THAT NOW!!!
Perhaps I... underestimated you.
But worry not!! I have decided!!!
I will turn over a new leaf from now on...
And FIGHT! For the side...
OF IGNORANCE!!!
WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU TO BE STUPID!!!
Just, sometimes it's OK to make mistakes!!
Hahaha - and make mistakes, I will!!!
Onward!!

O-oh!! Kris, Susie!! Umm, how may I serve you...?
The hell are you doing!?
Umm, Queen didn't have a room for me, so... err...
She made me into one of her butlers, instead...
Whatever!! Ralsei! Can you heal Lancer!?
O-oh!
Haha... it's... cold...
... Susie...
...
I'm afraid... This is something I can't heal.
Wh-what?
Lancer is...
Lancer!? Lancer, hey...!!
You see, each Dark Fountain creates a different "world."
A "world" whose Darkners reflect the will of its fountain.
＊ その世界を生み出した 　 「闇の泉」の意志を 　 受け継いだ者たちなんだよ。
But, though those Darkners can exist in their own worlds...
They might not "belong" if they go to another one.
... so can we help him!?
Yes. There is a way.
Castle Town's Grand Fountain is made of pure darkness.
As long as it stays flowing, any Darkner can live there.
So... if we bring Lancer back to school, he'll be OK again.
... So we just need to get out of here, huh?
Right.
... alright.
Lancer, we'll be back for you, buddy...
Your friend... If we defeat Queen, we can save him?
Uh, yeah.
With me out of the way, Queen...
... is going to force Noelle to do her bidding.
And if Noelle doesn't want to...
... She might make her face into a robot one.
Susie...
Could you... assist me in saving Noelle?
... huh...? M-me?
I... just can't do it by myself.
But if you can help me... I have a plan.
A plan?
I remember from Queen's tour of this place...
There's a secret shortcut on the third floor.
While Kris is distracting Queen,
Susie will take the shortcut to reach Noelle,
And transfer her to me on the roof.
From there, I'll bring her to a safe hiding spot...
And together, we can all defeat Queen!
Alright, sure. We'll give it a shot.
Haha! Most excellent!! Then...
See you on the roof, fellow agent!
Alright, let's go!
... would you take that off already!?
S-sorry!

W-wait, what are you...
H-Hey, you can't capture someone who's already captured!!
S... Susie!?
You... you saved me...?
Don't get used to it.
Umm, OK, I... I won't...!
...
Cool moon.
Y... yeah.
... b-but it's weird, isn't it?
How did we get here...?
No, what even is this place...?
Uhhh... you're, uh... just having a dream!
H... huh...?
Oh... Oh, that's right.
Right... if YOU'RE here, it must be a dream...
???????
I MEAN, the real Susie probably wouldn't save me, would she...?
She... probably doesn't care about me at all.
Huh?
Why would you, uh... think that?
Umm, she doesn't care about anybody.
Well, FAIR, but...
Didja ever wonder why Susie never... picked on you?
(sigh)... All the time...
MAYBE it's 'cause, when she first came to class.
You lent her one of your pencils,
Like, a dumb, uh, candycane-looking one or something.
And, even though it DIDN'T actually taste like candy,
She, uh, remembered your smile, and, uh...
Decided to spare you. Y'know.
That's, um...
Really specific.
Yeah, well, uh,
... wait, did you say you ATE the pencil!?
I MEAN, LOOK!
Uh, hey, so, do you... dream about me a lot?
WELL, time for me to get back to my project, haha!
Okay, Susie, hit me with your ax and wake me up!
W-wait, no, I can't do that!
Huh? Why not? It's just a dream, so...
Umm, I mean...
Didn't you wanna... uh... hang out some more?
...
... I GUESS Berdly can wait a little longer.
Alright! Let's get out of here then.
All we gotta do is head to the right over to this...

... looks like we're coming up on a tunnel!

H-huh? There's something blocking the way...
Maybe we can find some way to get rid of this...?

Kris... hey, Kris.
choicetext
I'm happy hearing you say that, Kris...
Err, then, I, err -
Ah, s-sarcastic! I was just being sarcastic!
Haha, sorry about that!
Ah, just as I expected, haha.
I feel warm... thinking about how you care about her.
Kris, you can tell me anything anytime, OK?
(...)
(... and they stopped talking...)
She's a nice girl, isn't she?
Even though she doesn't understand it,
It seems she's already strong at this world's magic.
I believe she can control the "Ice" element.
... Kris, if you ask her nicely,
Maybe she'll make you a popsicle! Haha!
That's, um.... That's right.
This ride, um... it sort of looks like...
A bit bird-like?
... umm, what part of him are you thinking about?
(I suppose I don't mind no answer, either...)
H... huh!?
I mean, I'm thinking of you too, of course...
I mean, er -- you're right in front of me, but...
Oh, err, sorry! Did I say something strange?
I'm happy you and Susie are friends, Kris.
She's a nice girl, isn't she...?
When we first met, I...
I was so nervous about first impressions.
I even hid my face so you wouldn't see...
"How do I even be a friend...?"
All I have to do is be nice... is what I thought.
But I'm starting to realize, being friends...
Is more than that, isn't it?
Susie... sometimes she isn't nice at all!
She's selfish, she's rude, she's sarcastic...
But...
Isn't it wonderful that she's... her?
Is what I... started thinking, today.
...
I just wonder what... being "Ralsei-like" even is...?
Sorry! Haha, I got off-track.
Let's just enjoy the ride, Kris. Haha.

Well, let's go, Kris.
That's OK, Kris! Let's keep going.
K... Kris!?
D... did it r-really take a picture of that!?
Umm, l... let's keep going!
I bet it must have been a wonderful picture...
What? ... We were facing the wrong way?!
K-Kris!?
D... did it r-really take a picture of that!?
Umm, l... let's keep going!

THOU AREN'T EVEN GOING TO SHOWETH ME THE PICTURE!?
... that was a nice boatride, wasn't it, Kris?
I guess I do like slime and blood...
So, uh... Ferris wheels, huh.
Kinda makes you wonder what car they were built for.
(It's... it's different than riding one with Kris...)
... the hell's wrong, you scared of heights?
No! No, I... I love heights! Haha!
You're, uh, shaking.
Well, um, maybe, I'm a little scared, but... I...
To be honest, I... I actually like... scary things.
... what do you mean?
When we were little, me and my sister would stay up...
And go past our bedtime watching horror movies.
At first I cried, but now... it's like... watching them...
Makes me feel... comforted...?
Comforted?
It's scary, but I can just turn it off, right?
Now it's mostly... people, that are scary. Haha.
You can just say you mean me.
Haha... umm... well... I guess y-you too, but...
But that's... what's... NICE about you, y'know?
Nice!? The hell does that mean???
You're the... good kind of scary.
You aren't afraid to... break the rules, y'know?
... I wish I could do crazy stuff like you.
So, um...
If YOU could do something crazy right now,
What would you do?
U-umm... Well, I... I...
I'd... I'd jump out the window!
It's a dream, right?
I'd grow big angel wings,
And fly as far as I can, gazing back at it all...
The skyline shining like Holiday lights.
... that's kinda... beautiful?
Wait, you wouldn't seriously jump out, would you!?
Hahaha!! No promises!
... Susie...?
What do YOU think looking out there?
Uh... seeing everything small, makes me feel like, um...
If I was Susiezilla or something, I could wreck the whole city.
Hahahaha!!! Susie!!
Heh, what!?
... is being Susiezilla something you think about a lot?
No I just made it up now.
... does your tail always do that when you lie?
H... hey!! Don't look at that!!
I don't have a tail!! It's part of your dream!!
Oh, right. S... sorry.
Guess I'll just have to check in real life, too.
H-Hey!!! Don't!!!
Hahaha!! Susie? Everything OK?
LOOK, I just, uhhh -
I just don't like people knowing about, it.
Umm, well...
I think it's... a nice tail.
... whatever.
(It's wagging...)
... you stopped shaking.
Guess I got comfortable.
... me too.
Well, that wasn't too bad.
Y... yeah.
... sigh.
...?
If only I could dream like this every day...
Maybe...
It... doesn't have to be a dream. Y'know?
Susie...?
Maybe... maybe someday we could...
Noelle! My lady!! The Cavalry has arrived to rescue you!!
(Oh, the good part of the dream is over.)
It's fine!!! Berdly's gonna help!! We're allies!!
Yes!! Don't worry, Noelle!! I'm stupid now!!
(He's good!!!)
Look, I gotta go save the day now, alright?
H... huh!? Umm... good luck, Susie!!
Alright, nugget boy. it's up to you now.
Leave it to me, my dear Susan.
Yeah, whatever. May the smarts be with you.
Ah... she left before I could...
....
Noelle. It's hard to say this.
You've done so much for me, and I...
Noelle... I'm sorry.
Berdly...? You're... actually apologizing?
... Thank you. I... I understand, you know?
You've always... been nice to me when it's just the two of us.
You just wanted to make a happy world for me.
I'm... glad you realized, um... it sucked.
Oh.
Huh?
I mean, YES, I WAS, in a WAY,
Apologizing for THAT, but.
I also wanted to apologize.
For leading you on.
 
I know you only always helped me out because, well...
You had a crush on me, so...
WHAT?
O-oh, sorry! Please, don't be embarrassed!
It's understandable. But, I... I have to tell you I...
I really value your friendship, OK? So I...
I... felt I had to pretend to reciprocate those feelings...
WHAT? But I... I don't -- I never --
Furthermore, I think I may have...
Discovered someone else for me.
HUH????????????
Please don't be jealous.
OF???????????????? ???????????????
Susie
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

So that's why...

Heh, miss me?
Of course not!!

Man, we gotta work on your delivery.
Anyway, let's go!

There she is!
Queen!!!! Stop right there!!!
Ah My Sweet Idiot Children
You Are Just In Time To Witness My World Domination
With Noelle In My Possession
It Is Only A Matter Of Time Before Her Will Turns
And She Unleashes Her Power
Blanketing The World In --
Too late, dumbass!
Noelle's with Berdly!
Oh
Then Who This

B... Berdly!? But he's been...
Intercepted
My Control Plugs Are Now Suitable For Teenagers
Now The Whole Family Can Enjoy Eternal Servitude
(Sort Of Regal Mostly Cruel Laughter)
Wait, then... where's Noelle!??
(Laughter Becomes More Cruel)
Oh I Wonder (I Actually Know The Answer)
Enough already!
Oh Dear
I Do Sincerely Quite Like You Two
It Will Be A Shame To Force You To Serve Me
An Enjoyable Shame
Oh Dear It Seems
Someone Sipped Up All Of My Shield Power
In other words...
Nothing's stopping us from beating you up now, huh?
Well
Not Nothing
Mr. Birdy Here Still Has Maximum HP
So Unless You Want Your Dear Friend To Get Hurt
I Recommend
Letting Him Hurt You Instead
You... won't... control... me...
What
What Are You Doing
Taking... off... this... plug!
Stop--
Stop That At Once Your Arm Will--
STOP!!!
Berdly... what the hell, man!?
Your arm is... That was stupid...!
Yes... It was, wasn't it...?  
IT'S NOT PRAISE!!
Kris. Susie. I can't do much with a fried wing...
Please... promise. You'll save Noelle.
We... we promise!
Queen...!
You may have mastered the number three...
But can you stand up against FOUR of us!?
Running Simulation For: The Number Four
Hmm
You Are Definitely Going To Kick: My Ass
Unless
Oh No What That
W-wait! Wait one nanosecond! You... you cowardette!
You... you...
Alas...
B-Berdly!?
Haha, just now, was nothing more than simple bravado...
The truth is, that wire...
Already absorbed all of my succulent energy juices.
Berdly!! Hey!! Hey, Berdly!! Are you OK!?
Everything... getting dark...
(Only...)
(Only a kiss from a beautiful gamer girl can save me now...)
Berdly...
What?
Like, get you're, like, losing consciousness and stuff, but,
Could you speak up?
Umm, aha, s-sorry, suddenly I... I... I'm feeling a bit better!
Hey, that's a relief!
Well, uh, gotta hurry and save Noelle, so... later.
Ahh, dear Susan. So enigmatic in her ways.
But I can read her heart, Kris. Like a health meter.
And it's beeping... for love.
Haha! Well enough tales, Kris. Good luck.
May the smarts... NOT be with you.

The Knight
The Roaring Knight...
Today, It Deigned To Create This World
Reaching Its Long Hand To The Sky
It Coursed Its Will Into Its Blade
And Made
Thrusting The Fountain From The Earth
Unfortunately The World They Created
Is Trapped Within The Confines Of The Library
If Only We Had A Way To Make More Darkness
We Might Be Able To Cover The Whole World
That Is When I Realized
This Power... This Power Of The Will
This Power Of Determination...
Is This Not Something That All Lightners Possess...?
If One Was Simply
Determined Enough
Could Not Anyone Make A Dark Fountain?
So Then
If The Knight Has Taken Its Leave
Then I Will Simply...
Make A New One

Um, we could try flapping our arms...?
Fear not!!
Your knight in glow in the dark armor is here!!

Why do you want to unleash the Roaring so much?!
What Is That
Um... the Roaring.
Yeah That What Is That
If too much darkness is released...
Titans will emerge from the fountain...
And destroy everything.
All Darkners will turn into statues...
And all Lightners will be lost in eternal chaos.

Queen, are you okay...?
Seems she ran out of battery power.
Guess we can seal the fountain now, right everybody?
Everybody?
Queen... she said...
"Choose the world that makes you happy..."
I... don't want to live in a world ruled by her.
... but, if that wasn't the case...
I wonder if this world... wouldn't be so bad?
Huh?
... Susie, don't you think so too...?
I... uh,
Now that you mention it...
Kris, isn't this world just... BETTER?
We make so many... friends here. Y'know?
I've never... had an adventure like this before.
With axes... and battles... and magic.
Where everything can be healed with a little spell.
And no matter what happens...
No one tells us what to do!
Gosh, yeah!
S-so, even if things were really scary just now...
... I mean...
So is there any reason not to...?
Not that I can think of.
Me neither.
Then, Noelle... let THIS be my real apology!
Concentrating my will into this blade...
I will make a new Fountain...
And unleash a bright future!
A future that shines for US!
A future whose brightness... is born from DARKNESS!
STOP!
What...
In the world are you all doing?
Well, we thought we would just
Stop.
I mean -
Stop!
Do you realize what will happen if you do that?
I... we'll... just...
You'll bring the Roaring.
Oh Damn I Did Not Know That
You... didn't!?
But your whole plan was to --
I'm Just A Computer LMAO I Don't Know Everything
I Was Just Guessing Based Off The Knight's Actions
Why The Heck (Hell) Would I Want To End The World
W... well, that's a relief!
Uhh... ummm... I'm sorry. I... I...
After everything, I just caused trouble for you again, Noelle.
I Thought About It While Charging My Battery
That's Okay Berdly I Understand  
You Cannot Calculate Other People's Feelings
You... you understand how I feel?
Not Really LMAO I Just Don't Want Noelle To Be Sad
Haha, well... I'm glad... you two kind of get it now.
Guess we all... made a pretty sweet team in the end.
No We Freaking Didn't?
CAN YOU LET GO OF US NOW!?
Oh Yeah
S... Susie!!
Hey, you stood up to Queen. Not half bad.
R... really?
Uh, yeah.
... just, guess you gotta wake up soon, huh?
H-huh?
(Everything got so intense, I forgot it was a dream...)
Then... I just hope...
I get to have more dreams like this.
Hey, Noelle, when you wake up... um...
Well, I just wanted to say... uhh...
Well Then I Suppose It Is Time For You All To Exit

I Will Miss Each Of You

Alright! Time to do what we came here for...
Hey, Noelle.
... If you see the real Susie, just...

... uhh, you're in a good mood.
Did you, uh, have a good dream?
It was a nightmare.
Oh.
I'm... just happy I woke up.
The... end was nice, though.
What happened?
HAHA, w-well, umm ---
HAHA HEY, Berdly time to get up and go!
... Berdly?
Gosh, you've been studying too much, Berdly.
Honestly, you deserve a little rest, y'know?
Sweet dreams!
Wh... what are you doing?
You don't have a tail, do you, Susie?
H-huh!? N-no way, of course not!
Really? That's great!
...That was weird, Kris.
Somehow, it doesn't feel like we just saved the world...
H... huh...?
What... what happened?
Oh... it WAS a dream, wasn't it...
Huh... A dream? That was all... A DREAM?
... Of... of course!! That MUST have been a dream!!
Such feelings... such thoughts... Oh, sweet lady of justice!!

Uhhhh,

O-oh, right, I, err-- I--
What!? Studying with THEM??
Noelle!! Heavens to yikes!! They're... they're...
... Well, I guess we could... TRY it.
H... Huh?? My... my alarm??
Ahh, I'm going to be late for my shift with Ms. Boom!!
Oh no, how is it that late already!?
Well, adieu, everyone. I must gather my booklongings.
Ahh, how I love the texture of freshly-picked-up books!
Now, let us hasten, my dear Noelle!
H... huh? That's funny, my right arm... won't move.
O-oh...? It must have fallen asleep.
Here. I'll carry your books for you, Berdly.
Ah, Noelle... You're... always helping me. Thank you.
... Good day, Kris. ... Susie.
Bye Kris!
And... umm... bye, Susie!
Umm... see ya.
WHAT!? WHAT!? Are you looking for something!?
N-nothing!! B-bye!!
The heck is her problem, anyway?
Way to treat someone who just saved the WORLD.
KRIS!! Hey, wait a sec, Kris!!
We... we just actually saved the world, didn't we!?
Damn, we really are heroes!
And no one even knows!
... guess it's better that way though, right?
People'd freak out if they knew the world's in danger.
... though, kinda sucks Noelle has to forget, too...
Whatever. Let's get out of here.
(Before you left, you gathered up everything in the room...)
... Man, it got late, didn't it...?

Oh, you do? And you are... Susie, are you not?
H... huh? You, um... remember my name, too...?
Of course. Ms. Alphys is a good friend of mine.
She often talks about you!
... umm, glad to hear it.
(Kris, the hell is Alphys saying about me!?)
Susie, why don't you wash your hands over there...
Then we can make the pie together?
Make it... together?
Uhh... but I don't know how to...
Do not worry, I can teach you!
... OK.
Kris, Susie seems like a nice girl.
I am very happy you are friends with her, but...
...
Kris, I... heard from Alphys, about her... behavior.
If by any chance, she, er, influences you, er...
Leave the chalk alone, alright???
Hands, uh... washed.
Wonderful! Now we can...
Oh, Kris! How about YOU show Susie how to bake it?
Kris!? You know how to make pie!?
The hell haven't you made ME any then, dumbass!!
You pie-hoarding piece of -
I mean, uhh... 'scuse me, Ma'am.
Susie, you can just call me Toriel outside of school.
Oh okay sweet.
... huh? Kris? Oh, YOU need to wash your hands too?
Then, I suppose I shall teach Susie for now.
Susie and I will start getting ready to make the pie!
Uhhh, we will? Wait--!
(Kris! This is not the time to sneak some chocolates!)
(Kris, get me some at least.)

We already worked quite hard, have we not?
How about we finish it later?
... Umm, OK!
Then... uh... guess I'll walk home...?
Oh, no, no, there's no need to do that!
Oh, actually!
Susie, would you like to stay over?
Huh?!
I mean, umm... if it's OK, then...
Here, look at this!
Our couch is used to being used as a bed!
It's not perfect, but we could all sleep out here!
That... sounds good to me! Yeah!
Splendid! I will make sure everything is in order.
Just... call your parents, will you not?
Yeah, of course!
So what the hell, a sleepover?
Damn, I haven't had one of those in forever, heh...
(Hey, Kris, it's not like someone has to tell you to sit, right!?)
There, chill out for a sec!
So now what?
I got it!
Maybe... between... the pillows... here?
There! Knew I'd find the remote in there!
You can always find good stuff wedged in the couch.
Jeez, it's dusty. When'd you last use this thing?
... Well, who cares! Let's just watch TV!
So what are we gonna marathon tonight?
Blood Crushers 3? Hell Busters? Invasion of the Cat Petters?
Heh, maybe ICE-E The Movie's more your speed, huh, Kris?
HAHAHAHA!!! HAHAHAHA!!!
Hahahaha... haha... ha...
Heh.
It's been a good day, huh, Kris?
You, Ralsei, Lancer, everyone...
It's... just cool hanging out together, right?
... that's why, y'know... Don't you think we should...
Try to have them come to OUR world?
C'mon, think about how much better it would be!
Ralsei could do our homework... Lancer could live under your bed...
We could all walk to school together...
It'd... be perfect, y'know?
... Well, whatever, let's just get back to watching.
So the festival is coming up, right?
That thing where the town becomes... a carnival.
Stupid, right?
... Look, let's just go back to watching TV!
Now this is what I'm talking about!
A giant monster movie special!
(Always liked them better than the giant human movies.)
Now THIS is something we can MARATHON!
Are you READY Kris?
For 12 hours of building-bashing, car-crunching action!?
'cause we are LOCKED IN. Got it?
I better not see you move until your eyes are bloodshot!
Heheheh!
Now lemme just... get comfortable, here, and...
There!
(... Susie fell asleep.)
Officer...? Officer...?
Thank goodness, I finally got through...
I thought I saw someone prowling around outside...
And when I checked our car--
The tires... looked like they'd been slashed.
Officer, if you could please come over...
You will? Soon? Thank you...
... they're already asleep...

It seems after all I couldn't be anything more than a simple puppet.
But you three... You're strong.
With a power like that...
Maybe you three can break your own strings.
Let me become your strength.
(You got PuppetScarf.)
(You got Dealmaker.)
(You got ShadowCrystal.)
Hey so... are we seriously...
NOT gonna talk about any of that?
That was god damn weird.
Puppets... strings... hands...
What the hell does any of that mean?
And the way he just... broke.
I... don't think it meant anything, Susie.
It seems like it was just a corrupted program.
He turned into our ally, so let's just accept it.
(If you say it all strained like that,)
(... I'm not gonna think you're OK...)
(...)
(Hey Ralsei, you think Kris is OK?)
(Hmm... well, they seem a bit shocked, but...)
(Kris doesn't want us to worry, so...)
(Let's not push them for now...)
Kris, I'll make some cake for you later, OK?
I could even make it chocolate-flavored,
Butterscotch, cinnamon... whatever you want.
Well, their stomach's rumbling but the goosebumps aren't gone.
Kris, if you're cold, you can share my scarf...
Huh? Or, um, sure, Susie could...?
What? No, hell if I'm giving you MY jacket!
You make ME cold, I'm burning you knuckleheads for warmth.
Susie!!!
Too late, already imagining you guys as idiot-scented candles.
(... Heh, that got Kris smiling. Let's go.)
K... Kris? Are you OK? You're yelling...
There, there... everything's alright.
Don't think about what happened too hard, OK?
Just take some deep breaths and think about...
Something you like. Something nice... something soft.
I'll be right next to you until you feel better, Kris.
Guess Ralsei's right, Kris.
Whatever just happened... I guess...
Maybe it didn't mean anything.
I dunno why you came here, but...
Let's just be glad you didn't get killed. Heh.
(Just... tell us next time...)
(You're gonna do something stupid like this, OK?)
What? No, I'M not giving YOU a hug!
That's what Ralsei's for!! He's like a portable teddy bear!
But Susie, because you never give out hugs.
That increases their value. It's the law of supply and demand.
Well, I demand, you supply me, with, uh -
Ugh, enough of you guys!
... I think everything will be OK, Kris.
niseralsei
H... huh?
Hey, it says this is Noelle's room!
Kris, let's go in and save her!
And uh, y'know, teach her not to get in our way.
... Kris?
Fine, I'll do it myself!
Kris...
Don't you wonder... how they're doing in there?
Umm, I said, don't you wonder...
... how Noelle and Susie are doing?
Y-you're right, Kris, it has only been 30 seconds...
(I'll wait a minute first...)
Alright let's go!
H-huh? What!? W-wait -- wait!?
Wait, we were supposed to --
Hey, let's go!
W-wait! Wait, Susie!
What, um, happened in there?
What do you mean what happened?
U-umm... in there, with Noelle!
Nothin.
N... Nothing? Nothing at all?
Just told her everything is a dream.
Now she's feeling better.
... anything else?
No and let's go.
HEY!
Psst... I'll tell you later, Kris.  
(Oh well, as long as Susie's happy... right?)

Queen!! My splendid Queen!! Where are you!!
Oh No Don't Let Him Find Me
Ah, Kris... NOT the lifeform I was looking for.

Don't tell me you got abandoned!? HA!!
HAHA!! That's what you get for trusting Susie!! HA!!

K... Kris...? Isn't that the wrong way...?

So, um, any idea where Susie is?
What!? WHAT!? I'm just asking!! It's a normal question!!
Kris! Where were you!
Tut tut... even late for your own truce.
Well, not as if your presence even matters.
Ahead of us is a mind meltingly difficult puzzle.
So just take your nap time, Kris.  I'll handle it.
(I... only have to figure out how it works...)
Just a moment, Kris, I...
You... How'd you do that!? I... I...
... Kris. You c-can't tell anyone about this, okay!?
If anyone asks, I solved the puzzle!!
Got it? Not a word to ANYONE!!

Oh. Yes. She is a real... "master" at it, Kris.
God, teaching you sarcasm was a mistake.

I... I've never gotten a gift like this before.
U... ummm... I'm sorry, I...

I... I'll win something for you too, okay!?
One baseball, please!!!
W-wait a second!!

Alright. Where'd the hell'd you get this?
Perhaps they won it at that orb-tossing game.
Yeah, like Kris could ever win that!! Hahaha!!
They musta stole it or something!! Haha!!
S... Stole it...?
Wow, they must have really wanted to give it to you!
Well, takes guts to do something stupid like that.

Then I'll steal you something too!!

(Since we were little kids.)
(Are they saying they want things to go back to...)
W-wait, isn't that the plush I just gave Queen!?
What!? You want a refund!? So you can...!?
Come on, say that to my face!! Gosh!!
Kris, have you seen...
Kris!? We took a break from trucing for ONE second...
And you're ALREADY back with Susie?!
???????
Should have expected this... hmph...
You couldn't keep up with my puzzle-solving skills!
H... huh...?
A plush...? Of ... me?
With... nipples?
... Hmph. Guess I'll forgive you for now.
See you, Kris.
Why the hell'd you give it to Berdly!?
Why did you give it to Berdly!?
Um, what... unexpected kindness, Kris!

... Let's just get the hell out of here.
W... wait!!

All That Remains Is The Final Step
My splendorious Queen! There you are!
Phew! I looked in every used game store for you!
Sorry, I thought I saw you in a used game store, and...
Oh, Noelle. Are you okay? You look a little funny.
Okay Plan B

Looks like we finally found the fountain...
Yeah, but where the hell is Kris...?
Kris!
Where the hell were you!?
We were searching everywhere for you...
Even Susie was worried!
Huh!? No I wasn't!
Just, y'know, tell us if you're gonna...
Hey... Kris, you, uh, ok?
You look kinda...
Aww Kris, if you're hurt, Susie can heal you!
Yeah, that's right! I'm a healing master now, Kris!
I'm even better than Ralsei, so...
If, uh, you hurt yourself or something, then...
You could try doing a hug like I did earlier!
SHUT UP AND LET'S JUST GO ALREADY!
Uh-uh oh--
Noelle!? What are you doing with Kris!?
Um, I... um... I... I...
We... have a truce...?
A... truce!? With... Kris?
Hahaha!! That's impossible!
That would be double trucies.
Worry not, my dearest Noelle.
I know what you really want to say.
You.... you do?
Going along with all this...
You feel... forced, don't you?
It's why you're not with Queen right now.
Berdly... you get it?
Yes!! I do!!
Kris is FORCING you to be on THEIR side!!
Kidnapper!! Kris, our truce... is OVER!!!
Noelle!! This may hurt, but it's to help you!!
W-wait, just listen to me---!!!
Noelle! There you are!
Just in time! We can both go back to Queen and--
Noelle?
Kris, it looks like another enemy.
Should I freeze them?
N... Noelle?
Noelle, it's me, don't you recognize me!?
d.ogg
...!?!?
B... Berdly!?
Noelle, are you okay...?
What... what are you doing with Kris?
I'm just, we're just...
Getting... stronger.
Wh... what? Proceed... where?
Noelle, what are they talking about!?
...
Th-that's it, Kris! I don't know what you're doing...
But if you're hurting my friend Noelle...
Then I have no choice but to stop you by force!
Kris, ready yourself!!
W-wait, Berdly, stop!
Run away!
From... me!?
(Th... that's right, what was I thinking just now?)
(That's right... Kris is my friend, right?)
What absurdity!!! Kris!!
Did you leave your IQ points at home!?
Noelle is only going to be protected BY ME!
And I'll FIGHT HER to PROVE IT!
D-damn it!
Berdly, are you okay...?
Kris, maybe we should have gone easier on him...
Go easier!? Ha! Haha! Hahaha!
The only one going easy mode, was me!
You look... Exhausted.
I'm only tired of HOLDING BACK MY TRUE POWER!
Ah, Noelle. It'd be too simple to save you now.
Kris! Go ahead and train your strength values.
Try hard, and maybe someday you'll be a worthy rival.
Heh! Sometimes I can't believe how cool I am...
(He hit me in the face with a tornado...)
(If he would just listen to me...)
Kris...?
Umm, about just now...
(Seems like whatever was happening.)
(They snapped themselves out of it...)
(Proceed...)
(Why... did they keep saying that...?)
... w-wait, I get it!
You were just trying to make Berdly mad, weren't you!?
Come on, that's not nice, Kris.
... Though, it's not like I don't understand the feeling.
Fahahaha.
I guess we both kind of got carried away...!
(Really though, what... was I thinking?)

This... Strange world... this big city...
It's so wild... It kind of makes my head spin.
...?
Looks like another puzzle...
Maybe if I go... down... here?
(Sigh...)
(Kris is the only one who knows how weird I am.)
(It's not fair, y'know!?)
(Everyone knows how weird YOU are. Fahahaha.)
...when I said this city makes my head spin...
I didn't mean in a bad way... you know?
I always wanted to go someplace new, you know?
... And Dess... always told me she'd take me.
Somewhere like this.
Somewhere with shining lights.
... don't you miss exploring, Kris?
Back when the four of us were kids?
Gosh, remember that night we explored the forest behind the graveyard?
Ha, I know we never found anything interesting back there...
I mostly remember... Crying because I was scared.
But for some reason I feel... nostalgic thinking about it.
Dess wiping away my tears with Azzy's jacket...

Could be like a second home to you.
A place that you can go...
No matter what's happening outside.
Heh, well, we'll take a look.
Hey, lemme look at my freaking room a sec!1
Damn, all you wanna do is run off and steal cake.
(... is that projection?)
So, what do we do now?
Feel free to explore the town until you're ready to leave!
Hah! Like we're gonna leave now, right, Kris?

Don't wanna be banned from outside of school too.

Alphys? You're on your own.
(Alright, let's go.)
Whoa, go in there if you want, but... I'm staying here.
Catti's working there today. She hates me.
So WHAT if I took Jockboy's hat once? I looked cool!

Hmm... maybe we could try...
Iceshock?
Ice on the Ice Palace boss?
Don't you wanna try Fireshock or something?
H-huh? Yeah, you're right.
Here, how about letting me control for a bit?
N-no! I'll... control it myself.
Not like you to be a controller hog, honey.
You feeling alright?
Huh? Me? Of course! I'm fine, dad...
I just...
I fell asleep in the library, and...
... you know, just had a weird dream. Haha.
Noelle...
I knew that birdbrain'd put you to sleep! Haha!
What'd he do? Start lecturing you on his theorum...
Of the inequality in children's fighter games?
Hahah, no, no! He...
... he fell asleep, too.
Wow, he even put himself to sleep? Ha!
Haha, yeah, I guess so!
Well. Sounds like...
You two've been hitting the books too hard.
Why don't you go home and hibernate?
I'll see you tomorrow at church.
Dad? Are you gonna be okay to go...?
Of course! You take it easy, honey.
Okay then... yeah, I'll go home and rest.
"Silver Drake?" I've never beaten this boss before...
Alright, hand it over, honey! I got this!
No, dad! This is my battle!
... So, um, how about just telling me what to do?
Haha, sure! How about trying Fireshock?
I'd love to, dad, but the mage left the party.
Oh yeah. How about one of your 99 Blaze Potions?
Umm, I'm saving those?
For what? Your birthday? C'mon, live a little!
OK, dad! This one's for you! Hiyah!
It... reflects fire attacks.
Hahaha! Whoops - hey, you gotta heal!
I wish I knew healing magic in real life.
Then I'd make you better and...
It wouldn't... just be me and mom.
... your mother is...
Hey, it's ok, sweetheart. I'm getting better.
Might even be able to go to church tomorrow.
... really? Are you... sure you're okay?
"Holidays happen whether you like it or not!"
"Even though everyone likes holidays."
... Well, gotta go home soon or mom will call.
See you tomorrow, honey.
Bye, dad. Love you!

Ohhhhhhh! THIS is Susie!
Susie! Nice! Heard a lot about you!
You, uh... have???
COOL, THINK I HAVE TO GO NOW!!!
Susie, huh?
... Yeah.
Lay a finger on her and I'll kick your ass.
Huh?
Hahaha!! Hahahaha!! Just kidding!!
Well, kinda kidding.
Hey, Susie. Mind if I have a word with you a sec?
Uhh...?
(Guess I'll be a sec, Kris...?)
And Susie, this is your room!
Umm, I tried to make it something you'd like, but...
You can put anything else you want in here, too!
I really hope you like it!
... My own room, huh.
I... guess that's pretty cool?
My own room... like this.

Well, er, since I last saw you two, I...

Once upon a time, a LEGEND was whispered among shadows.
It was a LEGEND of HOPE.
It was a LEGEND of DREAMS.
It was a LEGEND of LIGHT.
It was a LEGEND of DARK.
This is the legend of      DELTA RUNE
For millenia, LIGHT and DARK have lived in balance,
Bringing peace to the WORLD.
But if this harmony were to shatter...
A terrible calamity would occur.
The sky will run black with terror
And the land will crack with fear.
Then, her heart pounding...
The EARTH will draw her final breath.
Only then, shining with hope...
Three HEROES appear at WORLDS' edge.
A HUMAN,
A MONSTER,
And a PRINCE FROM THE DARK.
Only they can seal the fountains
And banish the ANGEL'S HEAVEN.
Only then will balance be restored,
And the WORLD saved from destruction.
Today, the FOUNTAIN OF DARKNESS-
The geyser that gives this land form-
Stands tall at the center of the kingdom.
But recently, another fountain has appeared on the horizon...
And with it, the balance of LIGHT and DARK begins to shift...

When the LIGHT is subsumed by SHADOW
When the FOUNTAINS fill the sky
flameya

All will fall into CHAOS.
The TITANS will take form from the FOUNTAINS
          And envelop    the land in devastation.
The surviving Darkners, crushed by the darkness
Will slowly, one by one, turn into statues...
Leaving the Lightners to fend for themselves
Lost eternally in an     endless night...
Is that your idea   of paradise?

You threw the 1 on the ground like the piece of trash it is.

I'll... go ahead and do the puzzle!
Isn't it a good thing?
I'm solving things by myself. Taking new things for myself. Defeating enemies by myself.
And every time I do it...
I'm getting stronger.
... what did I do when we got that ring? ... when I solved that puzzle?
... It... It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if I can't remember.
It doesn't matter if the battles are blurring together.
If Kris tells me to do it...
I can do things I could never do before.
... I'm getting stronger.
As long as I... just do what they say.
As long as I...
All finished, Kris. Should we find some more enemies?
It's a dead end...?
Hmm... the switch didn't seem to work?
Kris!! The platform's falling!! H-help me!!

Gosh, you're lucky Dess isn't here!
Otherwise YOU'D be facedown in a mousepile!
S... sorry, I didn't mean to get so mad.
Sure... okay, we can try again.
Kris!! What are you doing!! You made me --
H... huh?
S-sorry, Kris, you just saved me, didn't you...?
Th... this one's falling, too!
Kris, whatever you just did, keep doing it!!
What.
How did you...
HOW DID YOU SOLVE THAT??
Even a broken clock is right once a day.
And Kris, if anyone asks...
I solved the puzzle!!
It's not fair for YOU to get extra credit for a fluke!!
Get it!? Let NO ONE think otherwise! ESPECIALLY Susie!
You KNOW she'd just... lord it over me!

??????????
(Powerless!?)
SIMPLETON?
... H-huh? Berdly?
BERDLY??? BERDLY KNOWS???
Berdly...
WHY THAT!?
Ahh, Kris. Stuck on this puzzle, I see?
I thought I heard Noelle calling for help, but...
I get what that sound was now. Kris.
Your brain must be crying.
Poor, sweet, Noelle. Where could she be now.
Stuck on a puzzle just like this one, no doubt.
If only I was there to do it for her.
She's but a powerless doe without my help... 
Though being alone might be better than being with you!
Kris, you would only get in the way!
After all, you can't understand Noelle like I can.
Yes, you may have been her lifelong neighbor. But.
I am a maestro of emotional intelligence.
I can read her feelings like a strategy guide.
Which, I have NEVER needed by the way!
You may see her as the simpleton girl next door. 
But the reality. Is that she is.
A lovestruck girl with her heart on her sleeve. 
And... Kris... The target of her affection...
May be surprising to you.
It's... Truly sad. Such love... May never fruit.
But still, I have to support her, Kris.
She's my friend.
Also, my only worthy opponent at racing games. 
(Is that really what you're gonna end it on!?)

Hmm, looks like you need to hold it down.
Kris, you keep standing on this one!
OK, now you come over here!
Kris! Get back here!!
Nice teamwork!
(This is reminding me of our group projects...)
A--aahhh!!
K... Kris! C'mon, you... you know that isn't very nice!
(I was almost roast deer for a second there...)
Alright, now it's your turn!
Fahahaha! How'd you like that!?
You should have seen the look on your face!!

When you step off the switch, the lightning comes back...
How about... I hold it down, and you go across?

Oh It Was Not A Recommendation
I Was Just Warning You LMAO

If you're something else, maybe a Dating Shoes isn't right...?
Maybe I could interest you in a FreezeRing?
Huh...? A ring...?
Faha, sorry, I don't think WE need something like that!
C'mon, angel! You can't get stronger without good equipment!
Stronger...? R-right, I guess that's how it works here...
(You got the FreezeRing.)
(What... what just happened?)
(Did I actually just...)
(No, they... they must have given it to us. The ring.)
(...)
(Besides... it's good to get stronger, isn't it?)
Th... thanks, Kris!
(Though, if Susie bought me a ring...)

K-Kris...? Are you sure this isn't the wrong way?
THAT'S A LOT OF INSTANCES
Looks like a hole to put mice in, but you don't have any mice.
(You don't have enough mice to fill up the hole.)

Alphys
W-well, of course
  I'm going to go
  out and...
Um...
No, I should be
  honest!!
I'm gonna stay inside
  and watch anime like
  a total loser!
(Oh My God?)
(Frisk. Please.)
(Help me explain what
  anime is to Asgore.)
Y-you see, it's
  like a cartoon,
  but...
H-hold on, uh...
I think I have
  some on my phone.
Here, l-look at
  this!
...
*...Oh, uh...
Um... that's the...
That's the wrong...
Uh, nevermind.
Eheheh... yeah!
It sure is!
Psst...
F-Frisk.
Um, you've gotta
  tell me.
D... do you think
  Asgore and Toriel
  are...?
Uh, ever gonna get
  back together?
Error...
Y-yeah!!!
Yeah, that's what
  I hope, too.
Just think about how
  cute they must have
  been together.
It's quickly becoming
  my number one ship
  of all time.
Tori and Gorey...
My...
My old boss and
  his ex-wife.
... uh, that sounds
  a lot less cool
  all of a sudden.
... yeah, that's what
  I thought.
A woman can dream
  though, right?
And write fanfiction.
A LOT of fanfiction.
Y-yeah, Asgore.
Don't break Undyne's
  heart.
That's my job.
Wow... it's e-even
  better than on TV.
WAY better!
Better than I ever
  imagined!
D-don't do that.
Uh.... OK?
   
Uhhh, sorry!
I'm still getting
dressed!
H-how do I look?
My friend helped me
pick out this
dress.
She's got a great
sense of...
Um, anyway!
Let's do this thing!
H-h-hey, w-w-wait!
Actually, we still
can't start the
date yet!!!
Umm, I've gotta give
you items to raise
your affection
statistic, first!
That'll increase the
chance of a successful
outcome to the
date!
Right...?
Anyway, d-don't worry!
I'm prepared!
I-I've been
stockpiling gifts
in anticipation
for a date like this!
F-first, I've got...
Some metal armor
polish!
Um, maybe you can't
use that.
But!!!
I also brought some
waterproof cream for
your scales!
Your, uh...
Scales...
Uh, well, how about...
This magical spear
repair kit, that I...
Um...
Hey, let's forget
about the items!
Let's just start
the date!
Yeah!!!
Let's, uh, date!
... uh...
Do you... like...
Anime...?
H-hey!
Me too!!
Oh.
Hey!
Let's!!
Go somewhere!!!
But where's a good
place to go on
a date...?
...
I've got it!!!
Let's go to the
garbage dump!!!
Here we are!
This is where Undyne
and I come all
the time...
We find all sorts
of great stuff
here.
Heh, she's
really...
Uh...
Oh no.
That's her over
there.
I c-can't let her
see me on a date
with you!
Because, uh...
Well...
Oh no, here she
comes!!
Oh my god...
W... well, I guess
it's obvious, huh?
I... uh...
I really like her.
I mean, more than
I like other people!
I'm sorry.
I j-just figured,
y-you know...
It'd be f-fun to
go on like, a cute,
kind of...
Pretend date with you?
T-to make you feel
better?
Well, it sounds even
worse when I put it
like that.
I'm sorry.
I messed up again.
Undyne's the person I...
Um... really want to
go on a date with.
But, I mean...
She's way out of
my league.
N-not that you
aren't, um, cool!
B-but... Undyne...
She's so confident...
And strong...
And funny...
And I'm just a
nobody.
A fraud.
I'm the royal
scientist, but...
All I've ever done
is hurt people.
I've told her so
many lies, she thinks
I'm...
She thinks I'm a
lot cooler than I
actually am.
If she gets close
to me, she'll...
She'll find out the
truth about me.
What should I do?
The truth...?
But if I tell her
that, she'll hate
me.
Isn't it better
this way?
To live a lie where
both people are
happy...
Or a truth where
neither of us
are?
They say "be
yourself."
But I don't
really like who
"myself" is.
I'd rather just
be whatever makes
people like me.
Eheheh...
No, you're right.
Every day I'm
scared...
Scared what will
happen if people
learn the truth
on their own.
They'll all get
hurt because of
me...
But how can I
tell UNDYNE the
tr... truth?
I d-don't have the
confidence...
I'm going to mess
it up!
How can I
practice!?
Yeah... yeah, you're
right!
I've come this far,
I c-can't tell
her now!
Sh-she'd be really
hurt if she found
out, right?
S-so it'll just
be, uh, a little
secret!
What people don't
know can't hurt
them!!
Th-thank God I've
got an honest
friend like you!!
B... but what if she
finds out on her
own, somehow?
Or if I ever
m-mess up...
Sh-she'd find out
the truth, and...
Pr-probably be even
more hurt than if
I told her myself.
N-not to mention,
l-lying so far...
h... has...
Been really
stressful, and scary.
I think I'm going
to have to tell
her the truth.
B-but how!?
I... I don't have
the confidence...
How am I supposed
to practice
something like that!?
R... roleplay?
... That actually
sounds kind of
fun!
OK, which one of
us will be Undyne?
Oh. Right.
Obviously.
Ehehe.
Ahem.
H-hi Undyne...
H-how are you doing
today?
Ha! Ha!
Glad to hear it!!
Uhhh, so I'd like
to, um, talk to
you about
something.
Th... thanks!
You say that to me
a lot, and I
never know what
to say!!
But I know, you just,
mean it platonically,
because we're just
friends!
Eheheh!!!
Umm, you see...
I... I...
I... I h-haven't been
exactly truthful
w-w-with you...
Y... you see, I... I...
Oh, forget it!
Undyne!!!
I... I want to
tell you how I
feel!
Y-you're so brave,
a-and s-strong...
A-and nice...
Y-you always listen
t-to me when I talk
about n-n-nerdy
stuff...
Y-you always d-d-do
your best to m-make
me f-f-feel
special...
L-like t-telling me
that y-you'll b-beat
up anyone that
g-gets in my way...
WH-WHAT!?
UNDYNE WOULD NEVER,
UH....
...
I kiss her back...
S... softly...
I... l-look gently
into her eyes...
UNDYNE!!!
I CAN'T TAKE THIS
ANY LONGER!!!
I'M MADLY IN LOVE
WITH YOU!!!
HOLD ME, UNDYNE!!
HOLD ME!!!
I START HOLLERING!!
UNDYNE!!!!
I LOVE YOU!!!
UNDYNE!!!
KISS ME AGAIN,
UNDYNE!!!
M-m-me?
Undyne???
Uh, uh, uh, uh,
ok!
I'll say what I
think she'd say,
and you... ummm....
You show me what
I'm supposed to do!
*ahem*
Ngahhhh!!!
Hey, Alphys!
You look cute
today!
Which I say often!
But platonically
because I would
NEVER like you.
Talk, to you?
Hmmm...
I guess so.
I often seem
excited to listen
to you for some
reason.
I will make intent
eye contact with you
so you sweat while
you talk.
So, what is it?
What!?
A... alphys!?
What's gotten into
you!?
H-hotbaby!?
How dare you call
me that!?
First off, I'm a
baby KNIGHT!
Captain of the
babies!!!
Treat my position
with respect, or I
will strike you
down!
Uh, now pretend
I'm suplexing a
boulder for no
reason.
Um! Anyway!
What do you
want to say,
Alphys!?
What!?
So you've been
lying to me the
whole time...
Alphys!!!
I can't believe you!
You w-worthless
slime!
How could you
betray our
friendship!!
After how much I
trusted you!!!
WH-WHAT!?
I WOULD NEVER...
Alphys!
What are you
d-doing!
I s-say, pushing
you away from
me...
You sh-shouldn't
k-kiss me...!!
B-but, y-you're so
good at it...
B-b-b-because of what
you learned from
th-those d-d-dating
video games...
I....
I c-c-can't help but
k-k-kiss you back...
ALPHYS!
I'LL NEVER LOVE YOU!
NEVER WILL YOU FEEL
MY PASSIONATE
EMBRACE!!!
I, UNDYNE, WILL
NEVER KISS YOU
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL
LIPS!!!
NGAHHHH!!!
NGAHHH!!!!
I'M UNDYNE AND I'M
PILING ON THE
SMOOCHES!!!
U... Undyne!
I... was... just...
UHHH, YES!
I mean, UHHH NO!
I mean, we were,
 but
I mean, actually we
were only romantically
roleplaying as you!
I MEAN!!!
I mean...
Undyne...
I...
I've been lying to
you!
About... well...
Everything!
I told you that
 seaweed was like...
scientifically
important...
Really, I just...
I just use it to
make ice cream!
And those human
history books I
keep reading...
Those are just
dorky comic books!
And the history
movies...
those...
Those are just, uh,
anime!
They aren't real!
And that time I
told you I was
busy with work on
the phone... I...
Was just eating
frozen yogurt in
my pajamas!
That time I...
I... I just wanted to
impress you!
I just wanted you
to think I was
smart and cool.
That I wasn't
some...
nerdy loser.
Undyne, I...
I really think you're
neat, OK...
Undyne...
You...
Y-you're gonna train
me...?
 
 
    U-Undyne...
 
 
    I'll do my
    best...!
OH! OH! I KNOW
THIS ONE!!!
IT'S SNAIL ICE
CREAM!!!!!!!!
IN THE FOURTH
CHAPTER EVERYONE
GOES TO THE
BEACH!!!
AND SHE BUYS
ICE CREAM FOR
ALL OF HER
FRIENDS!!!!
BUT IT'S SNAIL
FLAVOR AND SHE'S
THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS IT!!!!!!
IT'S ONE OF MY
FAVORITE PARTS
OF THE GAME
BECAUSE
IT'S ACTUALLY A
VERY POWERFUL
message about
friendship and...
H-hey, I've done
research about this!
There are alternate
universes out there!
S-someday, maybe, I
could meet them...
You hate
me,
don't
you...?
I've got
to keep
lying...
All I do
is hurt
people.
 No, that's not true!
 My friends like me!
 And I like you,
 too!
Th-that last
  question...
He wasn't s-supposed
  to ask that one...
I... I just need
  a moment.
S... Sorry about
  that!
L-let's k-keep
  going!
S-so you're about
  to meet ASGORE,
  h-huh?
You must be...
Y-you must be...
Pr... pretty
  excited about all
  that, huh?
You'll f-f-finally...
You'll finally get
  to go home!
W...
Wait!
I mean, um...
I...
I was just going
  to...
...um...
Say goodbye, and...
I can't take
  this anymore.
I...
I lied to you.
A human SOUL isn't
  strong enough to
  cross the barrier alone.
It takes at least
  a human soul...
And a monster
  soul.
...
If you want to
  go home...
You'll have to
  take his soul.
You'll have to
  kill ASGORE.
I'm sorry.
I... I managed to open
  the lock!
Are you two...
Oh my god.
Mettaton!
Mettaton, are you...
H... hey...
D... don't worry
  about it...
I can always...
I can always build
  a different robot!
...
Why don't you go
  on ahead?
... thank GOD, it's just
  the batteries.
Mettaton, if you were
  gone, I would have...
I would have...
...
I m-mean, h-hey, it's
  n-no problem, you
  know?
He's just a robot, if
  you messed it up, I
  c-could always...
J-just build another.
Why don't you go
  on ahead?
H-hey!!!
Wh-wh-what's going on!?
Th-th-the door just
  locked itself!
Oh.
My god.
I didn't expect you
  to show up so
  soon!
I haven't showered, I'm
  barely dressed, it's
  all messy, and...
Ummm...
H-h-hiya!
I'm Dr. Alphys.
I'm ASGORE's royal
  scientist!
B-b-but, ahhhh,
  I'm not one of
  the "bad guys"!
Actually, since you
  stepped out of the
  RUINS, I've, um...
... been "observing"
  your journey through
  my console.
Your fights...
Your friendships...
Everything!
I was originally
  going to stop
  you, but...
Watching someone on
  a screen really makes
  you root for them.
Watching you, I felt
  like... like I was
  seeing an old friend.
S-so, ahhh, now I
  want to help you!
Using my knowledge,
  I can easily guide
  you through Hotland!
I know a way right
  to ASGORE's castle,
  no problem!
Well, actually, umm,
  there's just a
  tiny issue.
A long time ago, I
  made a robot named
  Mettaton.
Originally, I built
  him to be an
  entertainment robot.
Uh, you know, like
  a robotic TV star
  or something.
Anyway, recently I
  decided to make him
  more useful.
You know, just some
  small practical
  adjustments.
Like, um...
Anti... anti-human
  combat features?
Of c-course, when I
  saw you coming, I
  immediately decided...
I have to remove
  those features!
Unfortunately, I may
  have made a teensy
  mistake while doing so.
And, um...
Now he's an unstoppable
  killing machine with a
  thirst for human blood?
Ehehehehe...
Heh.
But, ummm, hopefully
  we won't run into
  him!
Did you hear
  something?
Well that was
  certainly something.
Wait, wait!
Let me give you my
  ph-phone number!
Th-then... m-maybe...
If you need help,
  I could...
Wh... where'd you get
  that phone!?
It's ANCIENT!
It doesn't even have
  texting.
W-wait a second,
  please!
Here, I upgraded it
  for you!
It can do texting,
  items, it's got a
  key chain...
I even signed you up
  for the underground's
  No. 1 social network!
Now we're officially
  friends!
Ehehehe!
Heheh...
Heh...
I'm going to the
  bathroom.
(O-oh n-no, is that another
  letter...?)
(I don't want to open it...)
(C-can't I just slide it
  back out...?)
(N... no... I can't keep doing
  this.)
(I'll read this one.)
(Um...)
(I-it's shut k-kind of
  strongly, isn't it?)
(Wait a second...)
Hey, if this is a
  joke, it's...
Oh My God?
Did YOU write this
  letter?
It wasn't signed, so,
  I had no idea who
  could have...
Oh my god.
Oh no.
That's adorable...
And I h-had no idea
  you, um, wrote that way!
It's surprising, too...
After all the gross
  stuff I did...
I don't really deserve
  to be forgiven.
Much less, um...
This?
And so passionately,
  too.
You know what, okay!
I'll do it!
It's the least I can
  do to make it up
  to you!
Y-yeah!
Let's go on a date!
Hey, Undyne!!
Wait up!!
W-we were so
  worried...!
It felt like you
  were out forever!
Ehehe...
Ehehehe...
AHA! AHAHAH!
HA!! HA!!!
Oh, Toriel.
You have NO idea.
(O-oh, that sounds
  REALLY good.)
(On second thought,
  maybe I'll o-order
  a pizza.)
I-I'll see if I
  can manage to find
  any like that, Undyne.
But they CAN'T fly.
On second thought,
  maybe I WON'T write
  fanfic of real people.
I mean, isn't real life
  already the greatest
  fanfiction of all?
Uh, don't tell
  anyone I said that.
Cause I'm gonna
  post it online!
I sure am excited
  to finally use the
  human internet.
I bet they have all
  sorts of things Undyne
  and I can watch!
Of course, Undyne!
What do you think
  we've been fighting
  for all along?
Jinx!
I knew you were
  gonna make that joke!
Well...
I...
TORIEL!?!?!
Hey Frisk, why
  don't you go look
  for Mettaton?
He was here for
  a while, too...
But he said he
  had to go somewhere.
Hey!
Stop!!!
I got you guys some
  food, okay!?
Sorry about that...
They get kind of sassy
  when they don't get
  fed on time.
Um!!
I think they smelled
  the potato chips you
  had, and...
Anyway!
The power went out,
  and I've been trying
  to turn it back on!
But it seems like you
  were one step ahead
  of me.
This was probably just
  a big inconvenience
  for you...
B-but I appreciate
  that you came here
  to back me up!
As I said, I was
  afraid I might...
Not come back...
But that's not because
  of these guys or
  anything!
I was just worried I
  would be too afraid...
To tell the truth...
That I might run away,
  or do something...
Cowardly.
Uh... I...
I suppose I owe you
  an explanation.
As you probably know,
  ASGORE asked me to study
  the nature of SOULs.
During my research, I
  isolated a power I
  called "determination."
I injected it into dying
  monsters so their SOULs
  would last after death.
But the experiment
  failed.
You see, unlike humans',
  monsters' bodies don't
  have enough...
Physical matter to take
  those concentrations
  of "determination."
Their bodies started to
  melt, and lost what
  physicality they had.
Pretty soon, all of the
  test subjects had melted
  together into...
Those.
Seeing them like this,
  I knew...
I couldn't tell their
  families about it.
I couldn't tell anyone
  about it.
No matter how much
  everyone was asking me.
And I was too afraid to
  do any more work,
  knowing...
... everything I'd done
  so far had been such
  a horrific failure.
... but now.
Now, I've changed my
  mind about all this.
I'm going to tell
  everyone what I've done.
It's going to be hard.
Being honest...
Believing in myself...
I'm sure there will be
  times where I'll
  struggle.
I'm sure there will be
  times where I screw
  up again.
But knowing, deep down,
  that I have friends
  to fall back on...
I know it'll be a
  lot easier to stand
  on my own.
Thank you.
Come on, guys.
It's time for everyone
  to go home.
H-hey!
Nobody
hurt
each
other!!
Uh,
h-h-hi!
(THERE'S
TWO OF
THEM???)
Y-yeah, ASGORE!!
Undyne's totally
right about that
fish thing!
S-sometimes you've
just got to, uh...
S-stop going after
furry boss monsters
and, uh...
J-just get to know
a really cute
fish...?
It's a metaphor.
He's
right.
LET'S
DO
IT.
Uhh, right!
S-sorry, I got a
little carried
away there.
H-hey, that
reminds me.
Papyrus...
YOU called
everyone here,
right?
Well, besides,
uh, her.
Uh, anyway...
If I got here
before you...
How did you know
how to call
everybody?
A tiny...
flower?
Technically, it's
impossible for you
to beat him...
B-but...
Somehow, I know
you can do it!!

Um...
I noticed you've been
  kind of quiet...
Are you w-worried
  about meeting ASGORE...?
...
W-well, don't worry,
  okay?
Th-the king is a
  really nice guy...
I'm sure you can
  talk to him, and...
W-with your human
  soul, you can pass
  through the barrier!
S-so no worrying, OK?
J-just forget about it
  and smile.
L-looks like you
  beat him!
Y-you did a really
  great job out there.
What?
Oh no, I mean...
You were the one
  doing everything cool!
I just wrote some
  silly programs for
  your phone.
... umm, h-hey, this
  might sound strange,
  but...
... c-can I tell
  you something?
...
B-before I met you,
  I d-didn't really...
I didn't really
  like myself very
  much.
For a long time,
  I f-felt like a
   total screw-up.
L-like I couldn't
  do a-anything
  w-without...
W-without ending up
  letting everyone
  down.
B-but...!
Guiding you has
  made me feel...
A lot better about
  myself.
So... thanks for
  letting me help
  you.
Uhhh, anyway, we're
  almost to the CORE.
It's just past
  MTT Resort.
Come on!
Let's finish this!
Hey!
This um, doesn't have
  anything to do with
  guiding you... but...
Uhh, hey, would you want
  to watch a human TV
  show together???
Sometime???
It's called, um,
  M...Mew Mew Kissy
  Cutie...
R-really!?
It's so good!
It's um, my favorite
  show!
It's all about this
  human girl named Mew Mew
  who has cat ears!
Which humans don't have!
S-so she's all
  sensitive about them!
But like...
Eventually!
She realizes that her
  ears don't matter!
That her friends like
  her despite the ears!
It's really moving!
Whoops, spoilers
Also, this sounds
  weird, but she has
  the power!
To control the minds
  of anyone she kisses!
She kisses people and
  controls them to fix
  her problems!!
They don't remember
  anything after the
  kiss I mean!!
BUT IF SHE MISSES
  THE KISS!!!
THEN!!
Then, uh, and, uh,
  also I mean, of course
Eventually, she
  realizes that
  controlling people
OKAY WELL I almost
  spoiled the whole
  show, but
Uhhh, I think you'd
  really like it!!!
We should watch it!
After you get through
  all this!
Um! Well!
That's okay!
Just thought I'd!!
Ask!!!
B-but I think you'd
  really like it!!
If you gave it a
  chance!!
U-uhhh...
(Oh my god, help...)
I'd like to order a...
Um...
A pizza...?
With, uhh...
The toppings are, uh...
I have them copied, I'll
  just paste them to you.
...
H-hey, Undyne, are
  you okay...?
U... uh, okay!
Man, she's tsundere...
Um, hi...
S-sorry, I hate
  talking on the
  phone.
I don't really know
  what to say.
Hey, why didn't you
  tell me the queen
  was so cute?
Uh, I mean, uh...
Mettaton's doing OK!
And! Um!
I'm trying to figure
  a way for us to
  get out of here!
B-but I kinda have
  no idea what I'm
  doing.
I'll figure it out
  eventually, though.
The queen is a lot
  different from
  ASGORE...
She actually checks to
  see if I'm doing
  anything.
She's really turned
  this whole place
  around!
Oh!
Hey!
Wait a second!
Hey! TORIEL!
Do you wanna talk
  to...?
Well, she says she's
  busy.
B-but, if you want
  to, call and talk
  to her any time.
G-good...
Good...
Hey, why do I
  have to be the one
  to hang up?
Eheheh...
I hate goodbyes...
Um, we'll see you
  again someday!
H... hey.
So... you're the one
  who killed all my
  friends.
I just called to tell
  you.
I hate you.
Yet... strangely...
It's because of you,
  that...
That I was forced to
  become a better
  person.
When I first saw you
  hurting people...
I just sat there.
Watching you.
I felt so guilty knowing
  I hadn't do anything
  to stop you.
I felt like all I
  do was...
Was hope you would
  destroy me, too.
But when Undyne called,
  with crazed desperation
  in her voice...
I...
I realized I had to do
  something.
Even if it meant
  everybody would...
Have to learn the
  truth about me.
It's strange.
You know?
Even after all the
  bad things I did.
People treated me like
  a hero.
And then they...
Asked me to run
  everything.
So I'm trying my
  best, here.
I think I have some
  good policies, but,
  y-you know...
Talking to people
  still makes me
  nervous.
I'm no ASGORE,
  you know?
God...
I miss everyone.
Now that they're
  gone, it...
It feels so clear what
  I should have done.
What I should have
  said.
Undyne...
Asgore...
Mettaton...
At least Sans is
  still here.
He's...
He's a good guy.
And with him around...
I...
Sigh.
You know.
Just daydreaming here.
But...
I really should have
  killed you when I
  had the chance.
H-hey!!
Th-this seems bad,
but don't worry!!
Th-there's one last
thing I installed
on your phone...!
You see that 
yellow button...?
Go to this phone's
[[ACT]] menu and
press it!!!
Now press [Z]!!!
U..uh... I can't see
what's going on in
there, but...
D-d-don't give up,
okay!?
Th... there's o-one
l-l-last way to beat
Mettaton...
It's... um... it's...
This is a work in-
progress, so don't
judge it too hard...
But, you know how
Mettaton always faces
f-f-forward?
That's because
there's a switch
on his backside.
S-s-so if y-y-you
c-c-can turn him
around... um...
And, umm... press
th-th-th-the
switch...
He'll be... um...
He'll be...
Vulnerable.
Well, g-g-gotta go!
Wh-what!?
Wh-why aren't you
  m-m-moving?
N-no...!
I must not have
  added enough fuel!
D-darnit...
I'm sorry...
Even when it's
  something like
  this, I...
I still...!
I still...
What?
Wh...
What are you...
H-hey, it's kind of
  dark in there, isn't
  it?
Don't worry!
I'll hack into the
  light system and
  brighten it up!
Oh no.
W-wait a second!!!
Couldn't you make
  a...
Couldn't you use
  a...
Couldn't you make
  a substitution in
  the recipe?!
    
Uhh, what if
  someone's...
Vegan?
    
Uh well I mean
Oh no!!!
There's not enough
  time to climb up!
F-f-fortunately, I
  might have a plan!
When I was upgrading
  your phone, I added
  a few... features.
You see that huge
  button that says...
"JETPACK"?
Watch this!
There!
You should have
  just enough fuel to
  reach the top!
Now, get up
  there!!!
Wow!
We... we did it!!
We... we really did
  it!!!
Great job out
  there, team!
W-well, uh, anyway,
  let's keep heading
  forward!!!
    
U-um...
I guess we...
... did it?
   
Watch out!!
I'll save you!!
I'm hacking into the
  firewall right now!
   
That's right!
Come on, Mettaton,
  give up already!
You'll never be
  able to defeat
  us...
Not as long as
  we work together!
Your puzzle's over..
Now go home and
  leave us alone!
Flames, deactivate!!
... huh?
Wh-wh-what?
TH-THAT puzzle?
I mean, uhh...
Great job!
We've got him on
  the ropes, now!
Okay, I'm back!
A-another dark room,
  huh?
M-my hacking skills
  have got things
  covered!
Are you serious?
D-don't worry!
I installed a
  bomb-defusing program
  on your phone!
Use the 'defuse' option
  when the bomb is in the
  DEFUSE ZONE!
N-now, go get 'em!
That's b-because!!!
While you were
  monologuing... I...!!!
I f... fix...
Um... I ch-change...
Yeah!
That's what I did!
W-wow...
W-we really showed
  him, huh?
H-hey, I know I was
  kind of weird at
  first...
But I really think
  I'm getting more...
Uh, more...
M-more confident about
  guiding you!
S-so don't worry
  about that b-big
  d-dumb robot...
I-I'll protect you
  from him!
A-and if it really
  c-came down to it,
  we could just t-turn...
Um, nevermind.
Later!
B-boy...
That was close, huh?
I guess a little
  closer than I would
  have liked.
I should have given
  you better directions...
A-and there j-just
  w-wasn't enough
  time...
W-well!
That's Mettaton's fault,
  not mine!
I c-can't second
  guess myself now.
I'm f-finally starting
  to f-feel confident
  about g-guiding you.
I'll protect you from
  that mean old robot,
  n-no matter what!
If I have to,
  I'll even t-turn...
We're over halfway
  to the core!
Let's go!
Error.
Great job!
Keep heading around the
  room!
Try to go for the
  one in the bottom-
  left next!
Try to go for the
  one in the top-
  right next!
Great job!
Head to the left
  next!
Great job!
Head to the right
  next!
You couldn't even
  get one bomb...!?
Error,
Great job!
Head for the center!
There's one left there!
Great job!
Head for the center!
I'm using, uh, EM fields
  to trap the glass of
  water there!
Great job!
There's only one left
  in the bottom-right!
Great job!
There's only one left
  at the top!
Great job!
There's only one left
  at the top-right!
Great job!
There's only one left
  at the bottom-left!
It's... it's...
M... more lasers...
Okay, I...
I won't mess around
  this time.
I'll just deactivate
  the lasers and let
  you through.
They're...
They're not turning
  off...
I can't turn them
  off, I...
I-i-it's okay!
I have this under
  control!
I'm going to turn
  off the p-power for
  that whole node.
Then you can walk
  across.
Okay, go!
H... huh?
I... I guess this
  was the right way.
W-WAIT!
STOP!
Th-the power...
It's turning itself
  back on.
D-damn it...
Th-this isn't supposed
  to...
I'm gonna turn
  it off again.
When it turns off,
  move a little, and
  then STOP.
OK?
Y-you won't get
  h-h-hurt.
Oh my god, are
  you okay!?
I-I c-couldn't keep
  the power off
  long enough...
No, no, we've
  got this, it's just
  a little further!
S-see?
I've got everything
  under control.
Everything's under
  control!
Oh my god, are
  you okay?
I... I'm sorry, I
  gave you the
  wrong order.
E-everything's fine,
  okay?
L-let's just keep
  heading to the
  right.
Oh my god...
Are you hurt?
I... I'm so sorry,
  I... I gave you
  the wrong order.
Everything's going
  to be fine, okay?
H-hey, why don't
  you try to use
  the elevator first?
H-hey, why don't
  you try to go
  to the right first?
Okay, you should
  be able to make
  it through here...
W-watch out!
Th-that was close...
Wh... why are there
  so many monsters
  here?
I mean...
It's no problem,
  r-r-right?
W-w-we've just got
  to keep heading
  forward!
Sorry, I... I...
I thought that...
Let's try the
  right path instead.
A-are you okay?
Why didn't you
  head to the
  right...?
C-C'mon...
Y-you trust me,
  d-don't you?
Huh?
Who are they?
N-nobody else is
  s-supposed to be
  here...
Oh well!
We can't worry
  about that now!
OK!
Now press the third
  one!!!
.............
.............
H-h-hey!
Looks like you!!! 
Only needed to press!
Two of them!!!
    
H-h-hey!
You did it!
I was worried I
  messed it up
  there...
But I guess we
  make a pretty good
  team!
What?
The elevator should
  be working...
W-well then!
Go to the right
  and keep heading up!
W-well then!
Let's go to the
  left!
H-hey, watch out!
You're going to get
  really hurt!
I can't watch this.
I'm disabling the
  lasers.
Th... there.
Be careful, okay?
I-I'm sorry, it's
  m-my fault you
  got hurt.
I didn't explain the
  lasers well enough,
  and..
If I hadn't...
If I hadn't...
Um, delayed using
  my hacking skills,
  I mean...
... sorry.
I didn't explain the
  lasers well enough,
  and...
O-oh, there's no
  time for this now!
Sorry.
OK!
Y-you should...
You should...
Head to the...
Head to the...
I... I...
I don't know?
This doesn't look
  like my map
  at all...
I'm sorry...
I... I...
I have to go.
W-wait!
No, I think you
  should h-head up!
A crossroads...
Uhh...
Uhhh...
Tr...
Try heading to the
  right!
Looks like you can't
  proceed until you
  hit the switch.
B-but, those lasers
  will activate when
  you do.
Ummm...
Looks like they'll
  come in this order:
Orange. Orange. Blue.
G-got it?
Move until the
  third one!
Alright, now just
  keep heading
  up!
...
That pit...
Isn't on my map.
Forget it!
Let's try the
  left side!
H-hey, aren't
  you gonna use
  the elevator?
I guess you can
  go this way!
If there wasn't
  a huge pit in
  the way...?
Wh... where'd this
  pit come from?
You should be able
  to walk across
  here...
Ready?
This is it!
Take the elevator
  up to the top
  of the CORE!
Hi, Alphys here!
This room is like
  the room we saw
  before.
There are two puzzles
  to the north and
  south...
You'll have to solve
  them both to proceed!
A-also... I'd like
  to say!
I don't really...
Like giving away
  puzzle solutions.
But if you need
  help, just call
  me, ok?
Actually, wait, I
  have an idea!
Let's be friends
  on UnderNet!
Then you can just
  ping me when you
  need help!
Wait, we're already
  friends, aren't we?
I signed you up,
  didn't I?
You've been reading
  my posts the whole
  time...
Well! I hope!
  You agree with me!
About Mew Mew 2!
Uh, h-h-hey!
I'm going to the
  bathroom, so I'll
  be MIA for a bit.
I'm... I'm sure you
  can handle this
  puzzle yourself!
S-see that building in
  the distance?
That's the CORE.
The source of all power
  for the underground.
It converts geothermal
  energy into magical
  electricity, by...
Uhh, anyway, that's
  where we're going to
  go.
In the CORE is an
  elevator directly to
  ASGORE's castle.
And from there...
You can go home.
Uuuh, I think...
Umm...
Hey!
About the puzzles on
  the left and right...!
They're a bit difficult
  to explain, but...
... uhhh, you already
  s-solved them?
Awesome!
Alphys! Here!
Th-that blue laser
  seems totally
  impassable!
B-b-but!
As the Royal Scientist,
  I h-have some tricks
  up my sleeve!
I'll h-hack into th-the
  Hotland laser database
  and take it out!
A-another laser,
  huh?
I'm sorry, I won't
  play around this
  time.
Hold on a second!!
    
Your next location
  is that door up
  north.
But! It's locked by
  two switched to the
  east and west.
So!!!
Head to those rooms
  first!!!
I.M.O!!!!
Acronyms kind of lose
  their punch out
  loud, huh?
A-A-Alphys here!!!!
Th... the northern door
  will stay locked until
  you...
S-solve the puzzles on
  the right and left!
I... I think you
  sh-should g-g-go to the
  right first!
H... h... hi...
It's me... Dr. Alphys...
I said I would
  guide you...?
But, um, I'm not
  very good at talking
  on the phone.
Errrr, anyway!
See those lasers?
Try to remember your
  elementary bullet
  pattern class.
Orange attacks can't
  hurt you if you're
  moving.
Blue attacks can't
  hurt you if you're
  standing still.
These lasers are the
  same way!
It's, it's sort of like
  that episode where
  they...
(Crash! Bang! Boom!)
Uhhhhh, gotta go!
Talk to you later!
Uhh!
H-hi, so, the blue
  lasers...
Uhh!
I mean, Alphys here!
Hi!
The blue lasers won't
  hurt you if you don't
  move!
O-orange ones, um...
Y-you have to be
  moving, and they...
Um, they won't, um...
Move through those
  ones!
Uhh, bye!
H... hi...!
It's Dr. Alphys.
This p-puzzle is
  kinda... um... timing-
  based.
Y-you see those
  switches over there?
Y-you'll have to press
  all three of them
  within 3 seconds.
I'll t-try to help
  you with the
  rhythm!
Um, is it really
  a good idea to be
  getting a snack?
Well, I guess I
  really shouldn't
  judge you...
After all, I'm the
  one eating potato
  chips in my PJs!
Uhhh, I mean...
H-hey, go over to
  the right!
H-hey!
Head over to the
  right!
Alphys (note)
Hey.
Thanks for your help back
  there.
You guys...
Your support really means a
  lot to me.
But...
As difficult as it is
  to say this...
You guys alone can't
  magically make my own
  problems go away.
I want to be a better
  person.
I don't want to be
  afraid anymore.
And for that to happen,
  I have to be able to
  face my own mistakes.
I'm going to start
  doing that now.
I want to be clear.
This isn't anyone else's
  problem but mine.
But if you don't ever
  hear from me again...
If you want to know
  "the truth."
Enter the door to the
  north of this note.
You all at least deserve
  to know what I did.
"elevator... lost power..."
"enter the center door..."
"drain... dropped it..."
"cold..."
"curtain..."
"under... sheets..."
Alphys (screen)
This is it...
Time to do what the King
  has asked me to do.
I will create the power to
  free us all.
I will unleash the power of
  the SOUL.
ASGORE asked everyone
  outside the city for monsters
  that had "fallen down."
Their bodies came in today.
They're still comatose...
And soon, they'll all
  turn into dust.
But what happens if I
  inject "determination" into
  them?
If their SOULS persist
  after they perish, then...
Freedom might be closer
  than we all thought.
things aren't going well.
none of the bodies have
  turned into dust, so I
  can't get the SOULs.
i told the families that
  i would give them the
  dust back for the funerals.
people are starting to
  ask me what's happening.
what do i do?
nothing is happening.
i don't know what to do.
i'll just keep injecting
  everything with
 "determination."
i want this to work.
Everyone that had fallen
  down...
... has woken up.
They're all walking around
  and talking like nothing
  is wrong.
I thought they were
  goners...?
We'll need a vessel to
  wield the monster SOULs
  when the time comes.
After all, a monster
  cannot absorb the SOULs
  of other monsters.
Just as a human cannot
  absorb a human SOUL...
So then...
What about something that's
  neither human nor monster?
Seems like this research
  was a dead end...
But at least we got a
  happy ending out of it...?
I sent the SOULS back to
  ASGORE, returned the
  vessel to his garden....
And I called all of the
  families and told them
  everyone's alive.
I'll send everyone back
  tomorrow. :) 
monsters' physical forms
  can't handle "determination"
  like humans' can.
with too much determination,
  our bodies begin to break
  down.
everyone's melted together...
I've been researching humans
  to see if I can find any
  info about their SOULS.
I ended up snooping around
  the castle...
And found these weird tapes.
I don't feel like ASGORE's
  watched them...
I don't think he should.
the families keep calling
  me to ask when everyone
  is coming home.
what am i supposed to say?
i don't even answer the
  phone anymore.
(It's too dark to see near
  the walls.)
I've chosen a candidate.
I haven't told ASGORE yet,
  because I want to surprise
  him with it...
In the center of his
  garden, there's something
  special.
The first golden flower,
  that grew before all the
  others.
The flower from the outside
  world.
It appeared just before
  the queen left.
I wonder...
What happens when something
  without a SOUL gains
  the will to live?
The barrier is locked by
  SOUL power..
Unfortunately, this power
  cannot be recreated
  artificially.
SOUL power can only be
  derived from what was
  once living.
So, to create more, we
  will have to use what we
  have now...
The SOULs of monsters.
one of the bodies opened
  its eyes.
experiments on the
  vessel are a failure.
it doesn't seem to be
  any different from the
  control cases.
whatever.
they're a hassle to work
  with anyway.
the seeds just stick to
  you, and won't let go...
no No NO NO NO NO NO
now that mettaton's made it
  big, he never talks to
  me anymore.
... except to ask when i'm
  going to finish his body.
but i'm afraid if i finish
  his body, he won't need me
  anymore...
then we'll never be friends
  ever again.
... not to mention, every time
  i try to work on it, i
  just get really sweaty...
ASGORE left me five
  messages today.
four about everyone being
  angry
one about this cute teacup
  he found that looks like
  me
thanks asgore.
the flower's gone.
But extracting a SOUL from
  a living monster would
  require incredible power...
Besides being impractical,
  doing so would instantly
  destroy the SOUL's host.
And, unlike the persistent
  SOULs of humans...
The SOULs of most monsters
  disappear immediately upon
  death.
If only I could make a
  monster's SOUL last...
i spend all my time at
  the garbage dump now
it's my element
I've done it.
Using the blueprints, I've
  extracted it from the
  human SOULs.
I believe this is what
  gives their SOULs the strength
  to persist after death.
The will to keep living...
The resolve to change fate.
Let's call this power...
"Determination."
(Golden flowers.)
Annoying Dog
And that's the
end of Hard
Mode!
That's the
difficult part.
Not the bullets.
But, accepting
that it's all
over...
Maybe.
Knowing the
answer is...
... HARD.
...
Hey!
Aren't you
supposed
to be dying or
something?
What will you do
instead...?
I thought it was
good.
Theoretically.
It's not like I
ate it all while
you were
fighting.
Hey! Hey!
Can I have some
pie!
I can helllp!!!
I'm not snoring,
I'm cheering you
on in my sleep!!
Oh, you're still
here?
Don't you have
anything better
to do?
I already said
that.
Annoying Dog (call)
Bark!
Bark!
Bark...
Bark!
(Snore... snore...)
(Achoo!)
(Yawn...)
(Blink blink.)
Annoying Dog-Bomb
Zzz...
Asgore
This is the barrier.
This is what keeps
  us all trapped
  underground.
If...
If by chance you
  have any unfinished
  business...
Please do what you
  must.
...
... I see...
This is it, then.
I see.
Anything you want to
  do is important
  enough.
Even something as small
  as reading a book,
  or taking a walk...
Please take your time.
Oh...
Back so soon?
How are you feeling?
Do what you have to.
Um... what's an...
... anime?
So it's like a
  cartoon...
But with swords?
So it's like a
  cartoon...
But with guns?
Golly!
That sounds neato!
Where is this?
Where can I see the
  Anime.
Golly.
Were those two robots...
Boy!
Technology sure is
  something, isn't it?
Frisk!
I just realized!
Now that we aren't
  fighting each
  other...
I can finally ask
  you...
"Would you like a
  cup of tea?"
Would you like a
  cup of tea?
Oh!
Well!
Actually, the cup I
  had is cold now.
So you shouldn't
  have it.
But, I am so
  happy you said
  yes.
As soon as I can,
  I will make some
  more for you.
Then we can be
  great pals.
Oh...
Okay.
Um, it's OK, Undyne.
My heart's already
  broken.
Am I invited to
  the trash?
Oh...
Isn't it beautiful,
  everyone?
I could stand here
  and watch this for
  hours...
Oh, right.
Everyone...
This is the beginning
  of a bright new
  future.
An era of peace between
  humans and monsters.
Frisk...
I have something to
  ask of you.
Will you act as our
  ambassador to the
  humans?
You cannot.
Human...
It was
nice to
meet
you.
Goodbye.
Now,
now.
There's
no need
to
fight.
Why not
settle
this...
Over a
nice cup
of tea?
Ah...
So that
is how
it is.
Why...
You...
I remember the day
after my son
died.
The entire underground
was devoid of hope.
The future had once
again been taken
from us by the
humans.
In a fit of anger,
I declared war.
I said that I would
destroy any human
that came here.
I would use their
souls to become
godlike...
... and free us from
this terrible prison.
Then, I would destroy
humanity...
And let monsters rule
the surface, in peace.
Soon, the people's
hopes returned.
My wife, however,
became disgusted with
my actions.
She left this place,
never to be seen
again.
Truthfully...
I do not want power.
I do not want to
hurt anyone.
I just wanted everyone
to have hope...
I cannot take this
any longer.
I just want to
see my wife.
I just want to
see my child.
Please...
Young one...
This war has gone
on long enough.
You have the power...
Take my soul, and
leave this cursed
place.
After everything I
have done to
hurt you...
You would rather
stay down here
and suffer...
Than live happily
on the surface?
Human...
I promise you...
For as long as
you remain here...
My wife and I will
take care of you
as best we can.
We can sit in
the living room,
telling stories...
Eating butterscotch
pie...
We could be
like...
Like a family...
No.
That's just a
fantasy, isn't it?
Young one, when I
look at you...
I'm reminded of the
human that fell here
long ago...
You have the same
feeling of hope in
your eyes.
There is an ancient
prophecy among our
people...
One day, a savior
will come from the
heavens.
... I believe the
one that was
prophecied was you.
Somewhere in the
world outside...
There must be a way
to free us from our
prison.
It pains me to
give you this
responsiblity, but...
Please.
Take my soul...
and seek the truth.
Ha... ha...
I'm sorry...
I couldn't give you
a simple, happy
ending...
But I believe your
freedom...
... is what my son...
... what ASRIEL would
have wanted.
You are our future!     
Forgive
me for
this.
This is
my
duty.
  You cannot give
  up just yet...
!
  Stay determined...
  Our fate rests 
  upon you...
  You're going to
  be alright!
  Don't lose hope!
  It cannot end
  now!
, please...
Wake up!
You are the future
  of humans and
  monsters...
Whoops.
Uh, should I do
  something?
Well, gotta go!
Now, now.
The important part
  is that Frisk is
  all right.
Here, Frisk.
Why not drink some
  tea?
It'll make you feel
  better.
Well, Papyrus, now
  that the war is
  over...
We might not need
  the Royal Guard
  anymore.
Howdy, Frisk.
Sorry about almost
  trying to take
  your SOUL.
I feel very bad
  about it.
I hope we can
  still be pals.
Oh... I see!
In that case, I'm
  not sorry, Frisk.
Oh, Frisk, if you're
  not busy...
On nice days, you
  should walk around and
  have a good time.
That's important.
Ready?
How tense...
Just think of it like...
A visit to the dentist.
Are you ready?
If you are not, I
  understand.
I am not ready either.
Dum dee dum...
Oh?
Is someone there?
Just a moment!
I have almost finished watering
  these flowers.
Curious.
I've never seen a plant...
Cry before.
... Here we are!
Howdy!
How can I...
Oh.
I so badly want to
  say, "would you like
  a cup of tea?"
You know how it is.
Nice day today, huh?
Birds are singing,
  flowers are blooming...
Perfect weather for a
  game of catch.
You know what we must
  do.
When you are ready,
  come into the next
  room.
You must be the one
  that flower just warned
  me about.
Howdy!
Erm...
What kind of monster
  are you...?
Sorry, I cannot tell.
Well, we can always
Tori...
You
came
back...!
... Tori...
You're right...
I am a miserable
creature...
... but, do you think
we can at least be
friends again?
Human, for the
future of
humans and
monsters...!
You have to stay
determined...!
Asgore (note)
(Howdy! I'm in the garden.)
(If you have anything you
  need to get off your chest,
  please don't hesitate to come.)
(The keys are in the kitchen
  and the hallway.)
Asgore (video)
Mmm?
What is it, dear?
... err, and why do you
  have that video camera? 
Hmmm...
Carrots, right?
Go back to bed, dear.
Hmmm... I don't know, honey.
What kind of dog would
  you be?
Hohoho!
You sure are excited to
  have this child.
You know, if you keep
  making jokes like
  this...
One day, you could be...
... a famous MOMedian.
Hey!
Come on, Tori!
That one was funny!
Goodnight, honey.
!
You have to stay determined!
You can't give up...
You are the future of humans
  and monsters...
Asriel
I always was a crybaby,
  wasn't I, 
... I know.
You're not actually
  
, are you?

's been gone for
  a long time.
Um... what...
What IS your name?
"Frisk?"
That's...
A nice name.
Frisk...
I haven't felt like
  this for a long time.
As a flower, I was
  soulless.
I lacked the power to
  love other people.
However, with everyone's
  souls inside me...
I not only have my own
  compassion back...
But I can feel every
  other monster's as
  well.
They all care about
  each other so much.
And... they care about
  you too, Frisk.
I wish I could tell
  you how everyone
  feels about you.
Papyrus... Sans...
Undyne... Alphys...
... Toriel.
Monsters are weird.
Even though they barely
  know you...
It feels like they
  all really love
  you.
Haha.
Frisk... I...
I understand if you
  can't forgive me.
I understand if you
  hate me.
I acted so strange and
  horrible.
I hurt you.
I hurt so many people.
Friends, family,
  bystanders...
There's no excuse for
  what I've done.
Wh... what?
... Frisk, come on.
You're...
You're gonna make me
  cry again.
... besides, even if
  you do forgive me...
... right.
I understand.
I just hope that...
I can make up for
  it a little right
  now.
I can't keep these
  souls inside of me.
The least I can do
  is return them.
But first...
There's something I
  have to do.
Right now, I can feel
  everyone's hearts
  beating as one.
They're all burning
  with the same
  desire.
With everyone's power...
With everyone's
  determination...
It's time for
  monsters...
To finally go free.
I have to go now.
Without the power of
  everyone's souls...
I can't keep
  maintaining this
  form.
In a little while...
I'll turn back into
  a flower.
I'll stop being
  "myself."
I'll stop being able
  to feel love again.
So... Frisk.
It's best if you
  just forget about
  me, OK?
Just go be with
  the people who
  love you.
You know...
I don't care about
destroying this
world anymore.
After I defeat you
and gain total
control over the
timeline...
I just want to reset
everything.
All your progress...
Everyone's memories.
I'll bring them all
back to zero!
Then we can do
everything ALL over
again.
And you know what
the best part of
all this is?
You'll DO it.
And then you'll
lose to me again.
And again.
And again!!!
Because you want a
"happy ending."
Because you "love
your friends."
Because you "never
give up."
Isn't that
delicious?
Your "determination."
The power that let
you get this far...
It's gonna be your
downfall!
Now, ENOUGH messing
around!
It's time to purge
this timeline once
and for all!
... even after that
attack, you're still
standing in my way...?
Wow...
You really ARE
something special.
But don't get
cocky.
Up until now, I've
only been using
a fraction of my
REAL power!
Let's see what good
your DETERMINATION
is against THIS!!
Huh? What are you
doing...!?
Urah ha ha ha...
Behold my TRUE power!
I can feel it...
Every time you die,
your grip on this
world slips away.
Every time you die,
your friends forget
you a little more.
Your life will end
here, in a world
where no one
remembers you...
Still, you're
hanging on...?
That's fine.
In a few moments,
you'll forget
everything, too.
That attitude will
serve you well in
your next life!
Ura ha ha...
Still!?
Come on...
Show me what good
your DETERMINATION
is now!
Ultimate bepis
Wh...
what did you do...?
What's this
feeling...?
What's happening
to me?
No! NO!
I don't need
ANYONE!
STOP IT!
Get away from me!
Do you hear me!?
I'll tear you
apart!
...
Do you know why
I'm doing this...?
Why I keep fighting
to keep you
around...?
I'm doing this...
Because you're
special, 
You're the only one
that understands
me.
You're the only one
who's any fun to
play with anymore.
No...
That's not JUST
it.
I... I...
I'm doing this
because I care
about you, 
I care about you
more than anybody
else!
I'm not ready for
this to end.
I'm not ready for
you to leave.
I'm not ready to
say goodbye to
someone like
you again...
So, please...
STOP doing this...
AND JUST LET ME
WIN!!!
I'm so alone,
I'm so afraid,
, I...
I...
STOP IT!!
STOP IT NOW!!!
Don't worry about
  me.
Frisk, please leave
  me alone.
I can't come back.
I just can't, OK?
I don't want to break
  their hearts all over
  again.
It's better if they
  never see me.
... why are you still
  here?
Are you trying to keep
  me company?
Frisk...
Hey.
Let me ask you a
  question.
Frisk...
Why did you come
  here?
Everyone knows the
  legend, right...?
"Travellers who climb
  Mt. Ebott are said
  to disappear."
Frisk.
Why would you ever
  climb a mountain
  like that?
Was it foolishness?
Was it fate?
Or was it...
Because you...?
Well.
Only you know the
  answer, don't you...?
I know why 

  climbed the mountain.
It wasn't for a
  very happy reason.
Frisk.
I'll be honest with
  you.
 
 hated humanity.
Why they did, they
  never talked about
  it.
But they felt very
  strongly about
  that.
Frisk...
You really ARE different
  from 
In fact, though you
  have similar, uh,
  fashion choices...
I don't know why I
  ever acted like you
  were the same person.
Maybe...
The truth is...

 wasn't really
  the greatest person.
While, Frisk...
You're the type of
  friend I wish I
  always had.
So maybe I was kind
  of projecting a
  little bit.
Let's be honest.
I did some weird
  stuff as a flower.
There's one last
  thing I feel like
  I should tell you.
Frisk, when 

  and I combined our
  SOULs together...
The control over our
  body was actually split
  between us.
They were the one
  that picked up their
  own empty body.
And then, when we
  got to the village...
They were the one
  that wanted to...
... to use our full
  power.
I was the one that
  resisted.
And then, because of
  me, we...
Well, that's why I
  ended up a flower.
This whole time, I've
  blamed myself for
  that decision.
That's why I adopted
  that horrible view
  of the world.
"Kill or be killed."
But now...
After meeting you...
Frisk, I don't regret
  that decision anymore.
I did the right
  thing.
If I killed those
  humans...
We would have had to
  wage war against all
  of humanity.
And in the end,
  everyone went free,
  right?
I still feel kind
  of sad knowing how
  long it took...
... so maybe it
  wasn't a perfect
  decision.
But you can't regret
  hard choices your
  whole life, right?
Well, not that I
  have much of a life
  left.
But that's besides
  the point.
Frisk, thank you
  for listening to me.
You should really go
  be with your friends
  now, OK?
Oh, and, please...
In the future, if you
  uh, see me...
Don't think of it as
  me, OK?
I just want you to
  remember me like this.
Someone that was your
  friend for a little
  while.
Oh, and Frisk...
Be careful in the
  outside world, OK?
Despite what everyone
  thinks, it's not as
  nice as it is here.
There are a lot of
  Floweys out there.
And not everything can
  be resolved by just
  being nice.
Don't kill, and
  don't be killed,
  alright?
That's the best you
  can strive for.
Well, see you.
Don't you have
  anything better to
  do?
It sounds like it
came from over
here...
Oh! You've fallen
down, haven't you...
Are you okay?
Here, get up...
, huh?
That's a nice name.
 My name is     
Finally.
I was so
tired of
being a
flower.
,
are you
there?
It's me,
your
best
friend.
I'm so sorry.
Ha... ha...
I don't want to let
  go...
You're...
You're going to do
  a great job, OK?
No matter what you
  do.
Everyone will be
  there for you,
  okay?
Well...
My time's running out.
Goodbye.
By the way...
... take care of Mom
  and Dad for me, OK?
I mean, we haven't
even done the 
Special Thanks yet...
Ready?
Let's end all of
this for good!
Ha ha ha ha...
Did you REALLY
think it was
OVER!?!?
Asriel (call)
...
Are you there?
It's been a long time,
  hasn't it...?
But you've done well.
Thanks to you, everything
  has fallen into place.
See you soon.
Asriel (video)
Okay, 
, are you ready?
Do your creepy face!
AHHHHH!!
Hee hee hee!
Oh!
Wait!
I had the lens cap on...
What!?
You're not gonna do it
  again...?
Come on, quit tricking me!
Haha!
Howdy, 
!
Smile for the camera!
Ha, this time I got YOU!
I left the cap on...
ON PURPOSE!
Now you're smiling for
  noooo reason!
Hee hee hee!
What?
Oh, yeah, I remember.
When we tried to make
  butterscotch pie for Dad,
  right?
The recipe asked for cups
  of butter...
But we accidentally put
  in buttercups instead.
Yeah!
Those flowers got him
  really sick.
I felt so bad.
We made Mom really upset.
I should have laughed it
  off, like you did...
Um, anyway, where are you
  going with this?
Huh?
Turn off the camera...?
OK.
I... I don't like this idea,
  
Wh.. what?
N-no, I'm not...
... big kids don't cry.
Yeah, you're right.
No!
I'd never doubt you, 
...
Never!
Y... yeah!
We'll be strong!
We'll free everyone.
I'll go get the flowers.
Psst... 
...
Please... wake up...
I don't like this plan
  anymore.
I... I...
... no, I said...
I said I'd never doubt you.
Six, right?
We just have to get six...
And we'll do it together,
  right?
Astigmatism
You've
seen
enough.
Take
your
last
look.
What are
you so
afraid
of?
Finally,
someone
gets it.
How
dare
you.
That's
right!
You
dare
defy me?
You've
pushed
your
luck.
That
takes
guts.
...
Don't
pick on
me.
...
Pick on
me.
The king decided
it was time to
end our
suffering.
Every human who
falls down here
must die.
With enough souls,
we can shatter
the barrier
forever.
Ball Game
Bravery. Justice.  
Integrity. Kindness. 
Perseverance. Patience.  
Using these, you were
  able to win at "Ball Game."
RED - Try as you might,
  you continue to be yourself.
ORANGE - You are the kind of
  person who rushes fists-first
  through all obstacles.
YELLOW - Your sure-fire
  accuracy put an end to
  the mayhem of "Ball."
BLUE - Hopping and twirling,
  your original style
  pulled you through.
GREEN - Your concern and care
  for "Ball" led you to a
  delicious victory.
PURPLE - Even when you felt
  trapped, you took notes and
  achieved the end of "Ball."
LIGHT BLUE - "Ball" is "Small."
You waited, still, for
  this opportunity...
... then dethroned "Ball" with
  a sharp attack.

Hmmm...
Isn't human food different
  from monster food?
It does things like "spoil."
And when you eat it, it
  passes all the way through
  your whole body.
Disgusting.
I'd love to try it sometime.
And I've heard they have
  things called bathrooms.
To a human, monster food
  would be very interesting.
As soon as you eat it, it
  converts perfectly into
  energy.
... that makes me wonder.
How do humans do it?
Eat during battle...?
Ice cream in one hand,
  sword in the other.
That's the way of the
  monster warrior...
Hmmm, this is around the
  time that Sans comes in.
Then, a little bit later,
  his brother comes in,
  irritated.
Yes, his brother.
Papyrus.
He's an interesting fellow.
He always orders a glass of
  milk...
He says it's "full of
  strong bones."
Hope he shows up today.
Soon, I'll be able to try
  some human food...
And then I guess I'll try
  a human bathroom, too.
Sans is interesting.
He has told me about all
  kinds of incredible foods.
But, despite his knowledge,
  he always orders the worst
  burger off the menu.

Greetings, Sans.

Hi.
I'm Bob.
A pleasing development, no?

Unfortunately, monsters are
  not experienced with
  illness.
However, when monsters are
  about to expire of age,
  they lie down, immobile.
We call this state
  "Fallen Down."
A person who has Fallen
  Down will soon perish.
In a way, this confusing
  situation was all too
  familiar.
When a human dies, its
  soul remains stable
  outside the body.
Meanwhile, a monster's soul
  disappears near-instantly
  upon death.
This allows monsters to
  absorb the souls of
  humans...
While it is extremely
  difficult for humans to
  absorb a monster's soul.
This is why they feared us.
Though monsters are weak,
  with enough human souls...
They could easily destroy
  all of mankind.
There is one exception
  to the aforementioned
  rules:
A certain type of monster,
  the "boss" monster.
Due to its life cycle, it
  possesses an incredibly
  strong soul for a monster.
This soul can remain
  stable after death, if
  only for a few moments.
Monster funerals, technically
  speaking, are super crap.
When monsters die, their
  bodies turn into dust.
One time this kid at my school
  went missing for a week and
  everyone thought he was dead...
But then he came back!!!
Turns out he was visiting his
  girlfriend in Hotland and
  and didn't tell anyone!
To be scientific, it sucks
  that no one ever knows
  if anyone's dead or alive.
So yeah, what do we do at
  funerals, anyway?
Professionally speaking:
DUH!!!
We pour the dust on whatever
  that person liked.
Then they will live on...
  ... in that object...
  ... symbolically...
Uhhh, did I reach the page
  minimum yet?
I'm kinda sick of writing.
Monster funerals, technically
  speaking, are cool as heck.
When monsters get old and
  kick the bucket, they turn
  into dust.
At funerals, we take that
  dust and spread it on that
  person's favorite thing.
Then their essence will live
  on in that thing...
Uhhh, am I at the page
  minimum yet?
I'm kinda sick of writing this.
Trapped behind the barrier
  and fearful of further
  human attacks, we retreated.
Far, far into the earth
  we walked, until we reached
  the cavern's end.
This was our new home,
  which we named...
"Home."
As great as our king is,
  he is pretty lousy at
  names.
"Typha" - A group of wetland
  flowering plants with
  brown, oblong seedpods.
Known more commonly as
 "water sausages."
While monsters are mostly made
  of magic, human beings are
  mostly made of water.
Humans, with their physical
  forms, are far stronger
  than us.
But they will never know
  the joy of expressing
  themselves through magic.
They'll never get a bullet-
   pattern birthday card...
Because they are made of
  magic, monsters' bodies are
  attuned to their SOUL.
If a monster doesn't want
  to fight, its defenses will
  weaken.
And the crueller the intentions
  of our enemies, the more
  their attacks will hurt us.
Therefore, if a being with
  a powerful SOUL struck with
  the desire to kill...
Um, let's end the chapter
  here...
"MONSTER HISTORY PART 4"
Fearing the humans no longer,
  we moved out of our old
  city, HOME.
We braved harsh cold, damp
  swampland, and searing heat...
Until we reached what we now
  call our capital.
"NEW HOME."
Again, our King is really
  bad at names...?
Love, hope, compassion...
This is what people say
  monster SOULs are made of.
But the absolute nature of
  "SOUL" is unknown.
After all, humans have proven
  their SOULs don't need these
  things to exist.
Bratty
Like, OK I guess.
Hey!
Check it
  out!
So, like,
what's up?
Thanks, but we,
  like, don't
  really need
  anything.
Oh my God.
Is that a
  glamburger?
Like, see
  you later!  
I'm Bratty, and
  this is my
  best friend,
  Catty.
Well, that kind
  of guy...
You hang out
  with him once,
  then he wants
  to hang out...
All.
The.
Time.
Oh, uh...
OK, like,
  the annoying
  thing is...
Oh, that guy
  from the
  store?
Yuck, what a
  creep.
So, we're
  like,
  totally
  free now,
  huh?
Where do we
  get the
  garbage?
Like, the
  garbage store,
  duh!!!
I mean, like,
  where does
  anyone get guns,
  or food, or...
The stuff
  inside, is
  like...
Oh, oops,
  really?
Uh, well,
  when we
  said, um...
We were
  hyped for the
  destruction
  of humanity...
We were,
  just, like,
  joking, you
  know?
So, like,
  Dr. Alphys
  built Mettaton,
  right?
Oh my God.
Mettaton.
He's like...
My robot
  husband.          
I think we're
  like... both
  going to marry
  him.
Hmmm...
Now that
  we're
  gonna be
  free...
Oh my God.
Alphys.
She used to
  live on our
  street.
So Alphys
  has always,
  like...
Oh my God.
He's a total
  goober.
Like, I LOVE
  that guy.
God, we're
  like...
SO hyped for
  the destruction
  of humanity.
Me?
Yeah, I
  LOVE cats!
They're,
  like,
  SO tasty!!
But, like, this
  stuff we found
  is like...
You should...
TOTALLY wicked
  buy all of
  it?
It's GOOD
  garbage.
.....
Waterfall
  mostly.                  
But like...
Mettaton always
  acts like...
And even right
  after he was
  built...
But they're
  like...
Not friends
  anymore.
I mean, like,
  if your big
  sister...
She showed us
  the coolest
  places to
  find trash.
Then she
  became the
  Royal
  Scientist...
So, like, I'm
  pretty sure
  she...
A robot with a
  SOUL...
So after seeing
  Mettaton,
  ASGORE...
Or...
  her at all...
Like, live
  a little,
  girl.
We don't.
Really need.
Anything.
God, Catty.
Try to have
  some
  self-control.
'Cause they
  OBVIOUSLY
  brought that
  Glamburger
  for ME.
C'mon,
  Catty, don't
  you have
  ANY
  standards?
But he just
  acts...
Really
  weird.
Like, when
  we asked him
  to get those
  Glamburgers...
We were,
  like, going
  to share
  them.
Catty!!
But like, if
  we let him
  hang out with
  us... I just
  worry it'll...
Um, that was
  NOT what I
  was gonna say.
Uh, so?
... so is he
  free after
  work?
Like...
Cool.
Like,
  milennia
  of being
  imprisoned
  finally over?
Probably?
It's, like,
  practically
  our
  catchphrase.
Um, no?
We've like
  literally
  NEVER said
  that.
That's, like,
  YOUR dream,
  Catty.
Aww...
Catty...
Catty!!!
I'm just
  kidding!!
Kind of.
Anyway, when
  was the last
  time you even
  SAW a cat
  around here?
.....
.....
... Catty.
I think that
  was, like...
A dog.
Bratty (note)
Hey, this is
  Bratty!
If you're
  reading
  this...
Alphys just
  came here
  and she's
  taking us...
But, first,
  we gotta use
  up these gel
  pens.
And don't even
  THINK about
  stealing our
  stuff.
Catty, it's
  not JUNK.
It's really
  valuable.
Anyway.
In closing:
You're a
  total loser!
Signed,
  Bratty <3
Burgerpants
The customer is always right.
Welcome to MTT-Brand
  Burger Emporium, home
  of the Glamburger.
Sparkle up your
  day (TM).
Anything else you need?
What can I do for you,
  little buddy?
(Why do I always
  get the freaks?)
How can
I help
you, O
customer?
Thanksy!
Have a
FABU-FUL
day!!!
So do
you want
it or
not???
That's not
the right
amount of
money.
You
don't
have
room.
We don't
HAVE
any
more.
Take what
you want,
little
buddy.
Here you
go,
little
buddy.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Sorry...
You can't
take it
for free.
You gotta
drop some
stuff.
Like I'm
making
THAT
again.
Are you
gonna
order or
what?
Here you
go,
little
weirdo.
Take it
from me,
little
buddy.
Nothing
else to
do!
(WHY IS THIS PERSON TRYING TO
  SELL ME SOMETHING THIS IS
  A HAMBURGER RESTAURANT I'M
  JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE)
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE.
Hmmm...
Why not try selling that to
  the two chicks in the alley?
Ah. Yes.
I really want to buy your
  weird dusty artifacts...
NOT.
Have a SPARKULAR day!
Any time, little buddy.
Alone again...
I'm getting on in years, so
  let me give you some
  advice, little buddy.
You've still got time.
Don't live like me.
I'm 19 years old and I've
  already wasted my entire life.
So we're free, huh?
Mettaton told us as much.
Then he told me, "don't
  think that means you're
  getting out of work early."
Ah... my boss.
I love that guy.
And by that I mean I hate
  him so, so much.
Evacuation?
You're yanking my chain,
  little weirdo.
So WHAT if everybody else
  left work?
So WHAT if nobody's buying
  anything?
Par for the course,
  little weirdo.
Par for the course.
I'm a goofy goober Yeah 
  this errorr. message.
Thank you, little buddy.
They wanna hang out after
  work?
Ha! Ahahaha!! Yes!!!
I won't let you down!!
Little buddy... thank you.
You've brought a tear to the
  eye of this old man.
So, uh, where do they
  want to go?
They want to hang out at
  the garbage dump.
Well, nowhere to go but
  up, right, little buddy?
Hey little buddy, wanna help
 me pick a spicy outfit for
 my little shindig later?
Though, now that I think
 about it, I had to throw away
 all of my clothes to make
 room for the outfits Mettaton
 gave me...
Don't take it the wrong way.
They're just all these...
Weird getups.
"Promotional" costumes.
For "holidays."
Or "specials."
Or "because he felt like it."
The thing IS though!
Most of the time I'm the
 only employee who has to
 wear this stuff!
Sometimes he even calls me
 into his office just to...
Make me put something on...
Then he laughs and lets me
 go back to work as normal.
Anyways, I won't sweat it,
 little buddy.
I'll take it casual.
NEVER let hot people think
 you care.
That's how they GET you.
Well?
Don't keep me waiting,
  little buddy!!
The girls were...
Talking about me...?
They say I should stop acting
  like they owe me...
... and if I want to be
  FRIENDS with them, I should
  just... uh, try to see
  things from their
  perspective?
Wow.
Poor, naive little buddy.
They've brainwashed you.
"Friendship" is just a hot
  person's way of making you
  their slave.
So, uh, what time would
  they wanna hang out?
Huh?
Yeah, those two vendors in back.
The girls.
NOT the Nice Cream guy.
He keeps coming in here and
 asking me stuff like,
"Hey Burgy, what do you think
 of this joke for my next
 ice cream wrapper?"
Joke?
Why are you calling it a JOKE?
You drew a picture of two
 dudes hugging and wrote
 "I love hugs!" on it.
You somehow understand comedy
 EVEN LESS than that guy who
 keeps going on stage and
 crying about his family.
Anyway, I, uh, just tell him
 that they're good, because he
 gives me the nice cream for
 free afterward...
Everyone calls me burgerpants
  now.
But you won't, will you,
  little buddy?
So I went out to the alley
  to see those two ladies, and
  uh... you know, see what'd
  happen next.
Then my boss, uh, saw me and
  asked me what I was doing.
I was so startled, the hamburgers
  in my pockets tumbled out
  onto the ground.
Not wanting to lose face,
  I scrambled to pick them up!
But, as I was leaning over,
  the weight of the remaining
  hamburgers...
... caused my pants to fall
  down.
Then the girls laughed at me.
Everyone calls me Burgerpants
  now.
Listen.
I like you, little buddy.
So I'm gonna save you a lot
  of trouble.
Never interact with attractive
  people.
Unless you're "one of them,"
  they're just gonna take
  advantage of you.
Like that time those two
  chicks asked me to sneak them
  some glamburgers.
And I, naive teenager that
  I was, said yes to them.
Bad idea.
Those girls?
The ones who saw my pants
  fall down?
Well, we're all gonna be
  free, so I'll never see
  them again, at least!
So we're free now.
Does that mean my double-
  date is cancelled...?
I know, it wasn't really
  a...
A date.
Here's a trick, little buddy:
Lie to yourself all the time.
It makes you feel better.
Well, Mettaton didn't tell me
  I HAD to work, I guess...
But that's the thing!
Sometimes he doesn't even
  call me into work until
  halfway into my shift!
If I don't play it safe,
  he's going to yell at me.
Okay, maybe "yell" is the
  wrong term.
It's more like he has this...
CD album he plays...
That's entirely full of
  songs about how bad I am
  at my job.
Let's not talk about this.
Why do people find him so
  attractive??
He's literally just a freaking
  rectangle.
You know, one time, I bought
  one of those, uh, kits
  online... to...
Uh, make yourself more
  rectangular.
They don't work.
God, have you even looked
  around?
This place is a labyrinth of
  bad choices.
And every time we try to change
  something for the better, he
  vetoes it and says "that's not
  how they do it on the
  surface."
Oh! Right!
Humans are always eating
  hamburgers made of SEQUINS
  AND GLUE.
When I first came to Hotland,
  it was my dream to work
  with Mettaton.
Well, be careful what you
  wish for, little buddy!
Don't tell anyone this, Little
  Buddy.
(Because they'll make fun
  of me,)
But I...
I feel like I played a hand in
  everyone getting free
  somehow.
Even if it was just
  working this awful job...
I think I did something!
I don't know if it's true,
  but I'll believe it anyway!
Huh?
Everyone else is DEAD?
Does that mean I don't
  have to work today?
God.
That it were true,
  little weirdo.
That it were true.
Future?
WHAT future?
Nothing down here EVER
  changes.
I'll probably be trapped
  at this stupid job forever.
But wait!
There's one thing that keeps
  me going!
If ASGORE gets just one
  more SOUL, we'll finally get
  to go to the surface!
It'll be a brand new world!
There's gotta be a second
  chance out there for me!
For everyone!
So stay strong, little buddy.
When I make it big, I'll
  keep you in mind.
Little buddy!
There's a brand new world
  out there waiting
  for us.
I'm sure with my (ahem)
  qualifications, it won't
  be long before I'm a
  famous movie star...
Or, maybe I'll just end up
  flipping burgers again.
But it's as I say!
Nowhere to go but up!
Literally, in this case!
Sorry, little weirdo.
Threats won't work on me.
I can't go to hell.
I'm all out of vacation
  days.
I'm sorry, (Ha ha) it's against
  the rules to talk to customers
  who haven't bought anything.
What?
Why do you keep trying to talk
  to me?
I'll get in trouble if I get
  chummy with the customers.
Sorry.
SO, I wanted to be an ACTOR.
Business Dude 1
The way to work is blocked,
  so I had time to catch
  Mettaton's show on my phone...
The special effects were
  amazing today!
That human almost looked REAL!
Of course, an experienced
  viewer like me knows CGI
  when they see it...
The barrier's opened up, so
  we don't have to go to
  work today.
I mean, sure, we're free,
  but it's the little
  things, you know?
That last episode had me
  really shaken...
But Mettaton's OK.
Everyone knows it's just CGI!
Business Dude 2
Mettaton?
Yeah, he's the most popular
  star in the underground!
His fan club probably has
  at least two... no, THREE
  dozen members!
And that's not even counting
  me!
Today, we all started as
  co-workers...
Who knows what we'll be
  tomorrow?
What a heartbreaker.
I bet his fanclub's almost
  doubled in size from that!
Business Manticore
This elevator goes straight
  to the capital.
But it stopped working.
The hotel's doing its best to
  accomodate everybody
  stuck here.
Me?
I just like explaining things
  to passersby.
Good news!
The elevator started working
  again.
But now it's been so busy,
  we still haven't gotten the
  chance to ride it.
Mettaton hasn't made a
  performance for more
  than five minutes...
What's happening...?
Can you explain it?
Catty
Bratty! Bratty!
That's MY name!
Yeah!
Check it
  out!
You should
buy ALL
our stuff!
Bratty!
We're
gonna
be rich!
So are
you gonna
buy it??
You need
WAY more
money.
You have
TOO many
items!!!
We're all
$$$$$old
out!
Mee-YOW!
Like, later
  and stuff!
I'm Catty, and
  this is my
  best friend,
  Bratty.
Oh my GOD,
METTATON.
Actually he's
  like...
MY robot
  husband.
We're both
  like, ALREADY
  married to
  him.      
He just, like,
  doesn't know
  it yet.
Oh my god,
ALPHYS.
She was like
  a big sister.      
He's a big,
  fuzzy
  goofball!!   
He's like,
  SO nice.  
God, we're
  like...
SO hyped for
  the destruction
  of humanity.
Me?
Yeah, I
  LOVE cats!
They're,
  like,
  SO cute!!!
TOTALLY wicked
  expensive.
TOTALLY wicked
  cheap.
Like...      
TOTALLY wicked
  buy all of
  it?
We found it in
  the garbage!
It's like,
  really good
  garbage.
.....
I found a gun
  in a dumpster!
That's like,
  what they
  TELL you.
... being built
  was HIS
  idea somehow.
... he acted
  like Alphys was
  an old friend.
Yeah!!!
Unlike me
  and Bratty!!
Best friends
  for-EVER!!!
Takes you on
  trips to the
  dump.
She was always
  collecting
  these weird
  cartoons.
Yeah, we
  haven't seen
  her in
  forever...
Thought ASGORE
  is a SUPER
  cutie.
Made Mettaton
  to, like,
  totally
  impress him.
That's, like,
  SUPER relevant
  to his hobbies!
Asked her to do
  all this science
  stuff for him!
But nobody's,
  like, seen
  anything from
  her yet.
She must,
  like, just
  stay in her
  lab all day.
Yeah!!!
Like us!!!
Oh my god,
  can you go
  get us some
  Glamburgers?
Wait! I'll pay
  you 1000G if
  you get Mettaton
  to autograph
  my butt!
OH MY GOD!!!
GIMME!!!
Sorry...
NOOO WAYYY!!!!!
Yeah! He's
  a creep!
But he's kind
  of cute,
  too...
Nope!!!
He'd be OK
  if he just
  treated us
  with some
  respect.
And then acts
  like it's OUR
  fault he
  acts that
  way!
He dropped them
  and ran away
  before we
  could even say
  anything!
Really?
I wasn't.
Yeah!!
He should come
  look for
  junk with us!
... be really
  super fun!
But I was
  close, right!?
But don't you
  feel bad for
  him, Bratty?
Poor
  Burgerpants...
Think about how
  cool we are
  compared to
  him!!!
We'd be saving
  his LIFE with
  our
  friendship!!
His LIFE,
  Bratty!!
... 
Think of all
  the glamburgers
  he could get
  for us!!
Yeah, like,
  totally
  free.
Yeah, like,
  cool.
Yeah, that's
  like pretty
  chill I guess.
Did we say
  that?
Really?
I thought our
  catchphrase
  was...
B-B-Bratty's
  the best,
  C-C-Catty's
  the coolest!
CAN it be
  though!?
CAN it be!?
OMG, we
  can finally
  fulfill our
  DREAM of having
  a pet cat!
But Bratty...
I don't wanna
  have a dream
  without YOU
  in it...!
And, in my
  dream, YOU clean
  up after
  the cat!
Bratty
  NOOOO!!!
Oh!!
JUST the other
  day!
There was
  this CUTE
  little white
  cat walking
  around...
It was, like,
  SOOOOOO
  clueless
  looking.
I pet it
  for like an
  hour!!
Yeah, Bratty?
DOGS ARE JUST
  FIRM CATS!!!!
Catty (note)
Hey, this is
  Catty! 
Then, like,
  bad news you
  mega-evil
  weirdo!
Someplace
  super duper
  safe!
Yeah!
Chill, Alphys!
We don't wanna
  waste pens!
Yeah, creep!
Leave our
  junk alone!
Yeah!
Our garbage
  is REALLY
  valuable!
Yeah!
Loser!!!
Nya ha ha!!!

(Knife inside the box.)
Interesting.
You want to go back.
You want to go back
to the world
you destroyed.
It was you who pushed
everything to its edge.
It was you who led the world
to its destruction.
But you cannot accept it.
Exactly.
Then what are you looking for?
Perhaps.
We can reach a compromise.
You still have something
I want.
Give it to me.
And I will bring this
world back.
Then it is agreed.
Then stay here for
all eternity.
Then, it is done.
About time.
Right where it belongs.
In my way.
Not worth talking to.

Wipe that smile off your
  face.
I see two lovers staring over
  the edge of the cauldron of
  hell.
Do they both wish for death?
That means their love will
  end in hell.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Greetings.
I am 
Thank you.
Your power awakened
me from death.
My "human soul."
My "determination."
They were not mine,
but YOURS.
At first, I
was so confused.
Our plan had failed,
hadn't it?
Why was I brought
back to life?
You.
With your guidance.
I realized the purpose
of my reincarnation.
Power.
Together, we eradicated
the enemy and became
strong.
HP. ATK. DEF.
GOLD. EXP. LV.
Every time a number
increases, that
feeling...
That's me.
Now.
Now, we have reached
the absolute.
There is nothing
left for us here.
Let us erase this
pointless world, and
move on to the next.
The demon that comes
when people call
its name.
It doesn't matter when.
It doesn't matter where.
Time after time,
I will appear.
And, with your help.
We will eradicate the
enemy and become
strong.
But.
You and I are not
the same, are we?
This SOUL resonates
with a strange
feeling.
There is a reason
you continue to
recreate this world.
There is a reason
you continue to
destroy it.
You are wracked with
a perverted
sentimentality.
Hmm.
I cannot understand
these feelings
any more.
Despite this.
I feel obligated to
suggest.
Should you choose to
create this world
once more.
Another path would
be better suited.
Now, partner.
Let us send this
world back into the
abyss.
Right. You are a

We'll be together

No...?
Hmm...
How curious.

I work at the CORE.
The inside is a maze made of
  swappable parts...
That means we can shuffle the
  layout at will.
Boy, was today a FUN day!
I sure love PUZZLE!!!
So, if we're leaving, will
  my job...?
Ugh, and I just got a raise!
Well, guess every apple has
  its CORE, heheh.
Today, we received the
  promise of a lot of money
  from a strange source.
It may not be kosher, but...
Whew! I love puzzle!

Oh, and the box lunches my

Besides Snowy.
We have to share ours
  with him..
Heh...
I guess we'll have to go to
  the surface.
There are woods there we can
  live in, right?
Guh huh huh huh.
Us teens rule these woods
  with a smaller-than-
  adult fist.
I'm worried about getting
  older...
I'll stop being a teen.
No! I refuse!
I'll just invent new numbers,
  like twenty-teen!
Clam Girl
I'm visiting Waterfall
  from the city.
Synchronicity...?
My neighbor's daughter looks
  about your age.
Her name is "Suzy."
I feel like you two should
  be friends.
You have...
A neighbor's blessing!!!
Not knowing where I live
  is no issue.
Fate finds a way.
In life's grand scheme, she
 might be why you came here
 in the first place...
I sense a disturbance in
  the nearby aura...
I think you should leave
  that girl alone.
So you never met my
  neighbor's daughter.
Don't despair.
This world has infinite
  opportunities.
But there's a limit to the
  things you can do today.
Accepting this is healthy.
Take my neighbor's blessing!
And consider this blessing
  for anything you like!
I wanted to tell you about
  my neighbor's daughter.
But you walked right by me
  before I could tell you.
Fate has decided that I
  should not tell you.
Clam Guy
O, k, k, k, k...
I was thirsty, so I came
  over from Waterfall to get
  a drink!
O, k, k...
What are you doing with
  all of that water?
So now we have a private pool?
Worse things have happened.
Are you just carrying that
  around to look sophisticated?
Cause it's not working.
I'll be able to have a nice
  drink on the surface.
Dad Slime
Ah, to be young again.
The world sure felt boundless.
You like to wander.
You must be young.
Seems like this is the
  beginning of a brand-new,
  boundless world...
Wah-ha!
This adventurous spirit!
I'm like a kid again!
And my children are like...
Double-children.
I've sent the kids inside.
It feels unsafe here today.

Diamond Boy 1
My fave Mettaton Moment(TM)?
Right when everything looks the
  baddest, he poses dramatically.
Like when he's on a cooking
  show and the eggs don't turn
  out right.
But!
Then he says!
Even if you suck at cooking,
  you can always buy an
  MTT-brand Glamburger!
Then he eats one! 
Everyone loves it!
... How does he eat it
  without a mouth?
Uhhh... well...
Watch the show!
That finale was really...
That was really sad!
And Mettaton's schedule
  doesn't show any other
  shows...
I've been thinking about
  getting a sick skateboard.
Diamond Boy 2
My fave Mettaton Moment(TM)
  is when he beats up the
  heel-turning villains!
Even if it's during what's
  supposed to be a quiz show.
Oh! And I like when he tries
  on all kinds of different
  fashionable outfits!
Even if it's during what's
  supposed to be a newscast.
Did Mettaton retire...?
Can't he unretire...?
On the surface we'll be able
  to watch all kinds of TV...
But, I bet none of those
  shows are as good as
  Mettaton's!
Diamond Receptionist
Welcome to MTT Resort - 
Hotland's biggest apartment-
  building-turned-hotel!
Whether you're here for a night
  or still live here, MTT Resort
  prides itself on a great stay!
Just passing through...? Nice!
MTT Resort prides itself on
  being passed through!
Sorry - the resort's shutting
  down.
But I think you'll find it's
  still great to pass through!
Welcome to MTT Resort!
Have you seen Mettaton?
He hasn't come by lately.
I have a lot of respect for
  that man.
I had trouble getting a job
  because I am so pointy and
  angular.
But, being a rectangle, he
  understood my struggles.
Dogamy
Take my
wife...
's fleas.
Don't
touch my
hot dog.
No. 2
Nuzzle

'98!!
Let's
kick
human
tail!!
Hm?
What's
that
smell?
What!
Smells
like a
...
Paws off
you
smelly
human.
Wow!!!
Pet by
another
pup!!!
Stop!
Don't
touch
her!
What
about
me......
........
Whine.
Whimper.
Hmmm...
Here's that weird smell...
It makes me want to
  eliminate.
Thanks, weird puppy!
You better watch where you
  sit down in here, kid.
Because that big guy WILL jump
  into your lap and give you
  lots of love and attention.
Where's Sans...
He's supposed to give me
  a pat on the head...
She hasn't been responding
  to our letters...
Maybe it's because we let
  Doggo write them all.
I was hoping Sans came in
  to give me a pat on the
  head.
Interloper...!
Where's that big lug?
We can't start until he
  shows up.
Smells kinda... quiet.
Hmmm, now that our parents
  are the same entity...
Does that mean I'm
  married to my sister?
Wait, we're dogs.
That stuff's normal.
Dogamy and Dogaressa
What's that smell?
(Where's that smell?)
If you're a smell...
(... identify yoursmellf!)
Dogs can pet other dogs???
(A new world has opened
  up for us...)
Weird smells can bring
  good things...
(Friendly fun fetch!)
Thanks, weird smell!
(It sure was fun to
  "stick" together!)
Hey, Sans.
(Hi, Sans.)
Dogaressa
(Don't,
actually
...)
(He
means
me.)
(Of
course
we were
second.)
(Do
humans
have
tails?)
(Smell
mystery)
(Are you
actually
a little
puppy!?)
(Beware
of
dog.)
(A dog
that pets
dogs...
Amazing!)
(That's
not your
husband,
OK?)
(Well.
Don't
leave me
out!)
(Misery
awaits
you.)
(Kneel
and
suffer!)
(I'll
chop you
in
half!)
(... Eliminate YOU!)
(We're sentries, but we never
  get any respect.)
(I wish those skeletons would
  throw us a bone.)
(We love bones.)
(Where are those skeletons?)
(I wanted to get a bone
  from them...)
(We're considering paying a
  visit to the doctor.)
(No! Not the vet!)
(... well, maybe she's a
  little like a vet.)
(I like Sans.)
(Sometimes he feeds us scraps
  of food under the table.)
(Then his brother gets mad...)
(But why!? We're adults!)
(We can handle it!)
(Where's Doggo?)
(I hope he didn't get
  lost again.)
(It's lonely in here today.)
(If our friends don't show up,
  would you like to play?)
(All of our parents have
  been combined into one
  horrible being.)
(That's OK, though.)
(It's really "brought our
  families together.")
Doge
You're
rather
slow.
Come on,
let's go.
Hurry
up...
Want to
go on
a walk?
Pet...
me...
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Oh boy!
Ahhhh,
humans
are
nice.
Hey!!
That
was
fun!!
Doggo
Don't
move an
inch!
It moved
!! It
didn't
NOT move!
Will it
move
this
time?
HUH!!!
A FUN
STICK
APPEARS!
WHAT!!!
I'VE
BEEN
PET!!!
WHERE'S
THAT
COMING
FROM!
THERE'S
NO END
TO IT!!
WELL,
THIS IS
THOROUGH
!!!
OK.
That's
enough.
FETCH?
PET?
PAT?
POT?
MOVING?
Did something move?
Was it my imagination?
I can only see moving
  things.
If something WAS moving...
For example, a human...
I'll make sure it NEVER
  moves again!
H... hey!
I can't stop shivering
  all of a sudden.
Who... who's there!?
S-S-S-Something pet me...
Something that isn't
  m-m-moving...
I'm gonna need some dog
  treats for this!!!
A stick appeared out of
  nowhere, then disappeared.
Was it a ghost stick?
Did I just return it to
  the afterlife?
I need some dog treats
  to think about this.
Hello?
Is anybody there...?
No?
Are you two playing a trick
  on me?
Real funny.
Big guy?
Is that you?
Come on...
Well, it's not the tall
  skeleton...
He's too loud.
Whoever you are, knock it
  off!!!
I'm thinking of getting a
  spiked collar to show off
  my personality.
It makes a statement like...
"Attach a leash to me and
  take me for a walk please."
He may not look like it,
  but this big guy writes
  the most eloquent letters.
Here, take a look!
Papyrus?
Is that you?
 Come on...
Undyne!?
Did you come all the way
  out here...?
Huh?
Since when did you and
  Sans become friends...?
I don't like him...
He loves to appear without
  moving.
Where're the other two?
I can't play with this
  big dumb guy alone...
He'll just win!!!
Sometimes the others like to
  prank me. They sit still
  so I can't see them.
They must be here, playing a
  joke on me.
I'll just wait until one of
  them admits it...
Having an amorphous,
  shambling family member
  is great.
They're always moving, so I
  can see them 100-percent
  of the time!
Dress Lion
Mettaton looked really...
Really cool in that dress.
It sort of makes me feel like
  I could wear one, too!
Mettaton...!
He recognized my voice from
  when I called in, and...
He... he gave me his dress!
I'm so...!
Ha ha ha!
Please don't talk to me.
I am feeling discouraged
  about something.
Drunk Bun
No matter where I go,
  it's the same menu, the
  same people...
Help!
I want new drinks an'
  h-h-h-hot guys!!!!
I guess the bartender's kind
  of h-h-h-hot...
C'mon everybody!!!
L-l-l-let's party!!!
... anyone?
Sansyyyy...
Come back and sit with me...
Everything's so fun when
  you're around!!!
It's s-s-so quiet in here.
L-lighten up everybody!
This is why I hate
  th-this place.
I w-wonder if the
  o-overworld h-has h-hot
  guys...
 A-and neat d-drinks...
Ooooooo, I'm ready!
H-hey, isn't Sansy s'posed
  to come swinging in right
  about now???
C'mon Sansy!
You're the life of the
  party...
Dummy

Echo Flower
Behind you.
(It's strangely silent.)
Sitting behind rushing water...
It makes me feel relaxed.
I swore I saw something...
Behind that rushing water...
I just wasn't ready for
  the responsibility.
A long time ago, monsters would
  whisper their wishes to the
  stars in the sky.
If you hoped with all your
  heart, your wish would come
  true.
Now, all we have are these
  sparkling stones on the
  ceiling...
Thousands of people wishing
  together can't be wrong!
The king will prove that.
C'mon, sis!
Make a wish!
I wish my sister and I will
  see the real stars someday...
Ah... seems my horoscope is
  the same as last week's...
Squeak.
(You hear a passing
  conversation.)
Don't say that!
Come on, I promise I
  won't laugh.
So? Don't you have any
  wishes to make?
... hmmm, just one, but...
It's kind of stupid.
I can't run any longer...
Somebody, anybody...
Someday, I'd like to climb
  this mountain we're all
  buried under.
Sorry, it's just funny...
That's my wish, too.
(You hear laughter.)
... hey, you said you wouldn't
  laugh at it!
Someday, I'd like to climb
  this mountain we're all
  buried under.
Standing under the sky, looking
  at the world all around...
That's my wish.
Of course I won't laugh!
... hmmm... if I say my wish...
You promise you won't
  laugh at me?
I'm gonna run around in a
  huge field of flowers.
Maybe I could jump without
  hitting my head.
... I wanna...
I wanna...
You wanna ride a train, right,
  honey?
I'll climb this mountain
  and...
I just want everyone to be
  happy...
Echo Flower (Echo Flower Explainer)
All that gives my life
  validation is explaining
  the Echo Flower...
No one can know...
Echo Flower (Flowey)
Where oh where could that
  child be...?
I've been looking all over
  for them...
...
Hee hee hee.
THAT'S not true.
She'll find another kid, and
  instantly forget about you.
You'll NEVER see her again.
Where am I...?
It's so cold here...
And so dark...
Someone help me...
Anyone... please...
Help me...
...
Echo Flower Explainer
This is an Echo Flower.
It repeats the last thing
  it heard, over and over...
Neat, huh?
Never trust a flower...
That's one of the constants
  of this world.
Elder Puzzler
Bahh!!!
Nevermind!!
So?
What are you waiting for!?
Bah! Today's monsters don't
  appreciate what makes
  puzzles great!
Nowadays "puzzles" are nothing
  but lasers and moving rocks...
Bahh!!!
There's no ART in that
  actiony, mindless schlock!
It's just timing-based drivel!
Give me something that
  challenges the deepest
  reaches of my mind...
You!
You're young!
You've still got hope!
Geh heh heh...!
Here... try solving this
  block-pushing puzzle!
Geh?
Who are you?
Freedom? What? Bah!
You're pullin' my leg!
You again!?
Bah! I don't care about
  going free!
Do you think humans could
  appreciate the details
  of classic puzzles...?
Bah!
What...?
WHAT are you doing!?
You're pushing it ALL WRONG!
Bah, forget it!
This generation is REALLY
  hopeless!

Faun
That dog considers itself
  an artist, but doesn't ever
  know what to create.
It probably doesn't help
  that its brain is the size
  of a piece of kibble.
That dog from earlier...?
It's at Grillby's.
I think.
After work, all of the dogs
  go there to play cards
  together.
But that dog doesn't really
  know how to express itself.
So, it ends up playing alone,
  instead of introducing
  itself to the others...
A dog just rushed in here,
  filled with inspiration.
It kept trying to build
  a snowdog that expressed
  its own emotions...
But, as it built, it
  kept getting more excited
  about the sculpture...
Its neck got longer and
  longer, and it added more
  and more snow, until...
It was rather sad to watch,
  but I couldn't turn away.
We're all free?
OK, OK...
I'll stop lounging around.
Does that dog know?
... it probably doesn't,
  does it...?

Ficus Licker
My mind is running wild!
I haven't felt like this
  in a long time...
Please leave.
You...
You came from outside,
  didn't you?
People like you are so
  rare...
Please!Stranger!
Well, what are you
  waiting for?
Oh!
You're back!
Huh?
"SURFACE"?
What do you mean?
I just meant outside this
  room.
If you haven't noticed, my
  mycelium have bound me
  to the ground.
Please!
Stranger!
I'll make this simple.
I've spent my whole life
  in the same spot,
  in the same room.
But I've long wondered
  what lies inside the
  room to the right.
Long I've fantasized
  about entering, and
  changing my scenery...
No...
Changing my LIFE!
Please.
Go and tell me what's
  inside.
Is everyone out there
  like you?
How terrible.
Oh, that's a relief!
That's all I need to
  continue my fantasies.
Thank you, stranger.
So it's the same.
The same...
Same...
OK.
As I came in, I realized I
  forgot to make a reservation.
But I didn't want to look
  like I messed up.
So I kept walkin' in anyway.
Now I'm just... kinda...
Consuming dew off this ficus.
Oh, we're all free?
Oh...
Guess I can...
Stop lickin' this ficus.
... but I don't want to look
  like I messed up, so
  I'll keep going...
What would Mettaton think if
  he saw me licking this
  plant of his...?
Eh... who cares.
Ficus Licker and Frisk
Tell me about outside...?
 
         Yes         No

Blub blub...
You'll have to reserve a

You'll also need to reserve
  your chair, your silverware,
  your food, your...
Blub blub...
Now we can live life
  without reservations.
Blub blub...
Mettaton isn't here to press
  his face into the steaks.
He told me that if he ever
  disappeared, we could use
  my face instead...
But, I'm nervous.
What if my face doesn't
  taste very good...?
Flowey
Howdy!
I'm FLOWEY. 
FLOWEY the FLOWER!
Hmmm...
You're new to the
  UNDERGROUND, aren'tcha?
Golly, you must be
  so confused.
Someone ought to teach
  you how things work
  around here!
I guess little old me
  will have to do.
Ready?
Here we go!
See that heart? 
That is your SOUL,
the very culmination
of your being!
Your SOUL starts off
weak, but can grow
strong if you gain
a lot of LV.
What's LV stand for?
Why, LOVE, of course!
You want some
LOVE, don't you?
Don't worry,
I'll share some
with you!
Down here, LOVE is
shared through...
Little white... 
"friendliness
pellets."
Are you ready?
Move around!
Get as many as
you can!
You idiot.
In this world, it's
kill or BE killed.
Why would ANYONE pass
up an opportunity
like this!?
Die.
Hey buddy,
you missed them.
Let's try again,
okay?
Is this a joke?
Are you braindead?
RUN. INTO. THE.
BULLETS!!!
You know what's
going on here,
don't you?
You just wanted to
see me suffer.
I already CHOSE
that name.
Why...?
Why did you let me go? 
Don't you realize that
being nice...
... just makes you
get hurt?
Look at yourself.
You made all these
great friends...
But now, you'll probably
never see them again.
Not to mention how
much they've been
set back by you.
Hurts, doesn't it?
If you had just gone
through without caring
about anyone...
You wouldn't have to
feel bad now.
So I don't get it.
If you really did
everything the right
way..
Why did things still
end up like this?
Why...?
Is life really
that unfair?
...
Say.
What if I told you...
I knew some way
to get you a better
ending?
You'll have to load
your SAVE file, and...
You'll have to
start over, and...
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you go see
Dr. Alphys?
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you go see
Undyne?
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you go see
Papyrus, then Undyne?
It seems like you
could have been
better friends.
Who knows... maybe
she's got the key
to your happiness...?
See you soon.
But, despite everything,
your happy ending
didn't come.
Why...?
I know why.
Go to Dr. Alphys.
Your date with her
has really just
begun.
So you went the
whole way through
without killing...
And then you decided
to kill ASGORE?
What the hell is
WRONG with you?
You COMPLETELY missed
the point.
Are you trolling me?
Because.
No.
You are only
trolling yourself.
What a waste of
everybody's time.
All you had to
do was make friends.
With Papyrus, Undyne,
and then Alphys.
But you were too
busy messing it up!
Hey.
Since you defeated me.
I've been thinking.
Is killing things
really necessary?
I...
I honestly don't
know anymore.
I have a request
for you.
Prove to me...
Prove to me you
are strong enough
to survive.
Get here from
the beginning.
Without killing a
single thing...
... and I won't
kill the king.
... and, maybe...
Then you'll have
your so-called
"happy ending."
So, what will
it be?
Will you prove
yourself?
Or will I get to
watch you suffer...?
Either way, I'm
interested!!!
Hee hee hee...
Interesting...
So, even with
everything you did...
The outcome's still
the same.
In the end, your
choices were an
illusion.
NOTHING you do
really matters!
Hee hee hee!
...
Well.
You DID do what
I told you.
I guess it's up
to me to get you a
REAL happy ending.
For starters, you
can't do it by
yourself.
Papyrus, Undyne,
Alphys... these guys.
Are you friends with
all of them yet?
Maybe you should go
back and... "hang"
with them.
The power of
friendship...
That always saves
the day, right?
So, killing people
is ACTUALLY fine...?
Sure.
I'm glad we agree on
the value of a life.
I've learned SO
MUCH from you.
Though... are you
REALLY gonna keep
doing things halfway?
The amount of people
you killed...
It's honestly
DISAPPOINTING.
You IDIOT.
You really can't do
ANYTHING right.
Why, 
...?
Why?
WHY?
We were on our way
to REAL victory...
On our way to making
up for LAST time!
Why'd you have to
SCREW IT UP?
Hahaha...
Is this REVENGE?
Making me watch you
act so pure and
happy, while I...?
Making me watch you
live out your life,
while I...?
...
No.
NO.
I KNOW what you're
doing.
You just want to see
what it's all like.
Before we TEAR IT
AWAY from them.
Ahahaha...
Genius, 
Well, I'll let you
mess around.
I know you'll come
back eventually.
And when that time
comes...
I'll be waiting
for you.
Why do you keep
coming back here?
Oh, I get it.
You wanna be friends,
huh...?
You're PATHETIC.
You REALLY think I
want to be friends
with YOU?
Heh...
You really DON'T
get it, do you?
There's only one
person I could care
about anymore.
And even then, I
couldn't TRULY care
about them.
I just like to think
there's someone out
there...
Someone that I
won't get tired of.
Someone like ME.
Quit looking at me
with that stupid
expression.
You're pissing me
off.
So you're here
again.
What's wrong with
you?
Are you trying to
start the Flowey
Fan Club?
Because if you
want to join THAT...
You'll have to
talk to Papyrus.
Yeah, he started
one.
A few different
times, anyway.
I won't lie.
He's one of the
better characters
to mess around with.
Took me a long
time to get bored
of that one.
... Yeah.
Talk to him
about it.
So.
Did you start the
Flowey Fan Club?
Ha.
I'm just kidding.
I was watching.
I know you didn't.
But I don't care.
Really.
He probably would
have invited his
garbage brother.
You know.
Smiley Trashbag.
Say.
If I have ONE piece
of advice for you...
DON'T.
Let his brother.
Find out ANYTHING
about you.
He'll... well...
Let's just say.
He's caused me more
than my fair share
of resets.
Stay away from
that guy.
Why do you keep
coming back here?
You don't REALLY
want to be friends,
do you...?
No. I get it.
You're just like me,
aren't you?
You don't care about
anyone.
You're just bored.
You just want to
see what I'll say.
So you can laugh
and throw me away
like a broken toy.
Well, TOO BAD!
I'm not LIKE everybody
else.
So, from now on...
You're not getting
ANYTHING.
Don't you have
anything BETTER to do?
Hi.
Seems as if everyone
is perfectly happy.
Monsters have returned
to the surface.
Peace and prosperity
will rule across the land.
Take a deep breath.
There's nothing left
to worry about.
...
Well.
There is one thing.
One last threat.
One being with the
power to erase
EVERYTHING...
Everything everyone's
worked so hard for.
You know who I'm
talking about, don't
you?
That's right.
I'm talking about YOU.
YOU still have the
power to reset
everything.
Toriel, Sans, Asgore,
Alphys, Papyrus, Undyne...
If you so choose...
Everyone will be
ripped from this
timeline...
... and sent back before
all of this
ever happened.
Nobody will
remember anything.
You'll be able to
do whatever you
want.
That power.
I know that power.
That's the power
you were fighting to
stop, wasn't it?
The power that I
wanted to use.
But now, the idea
of resetting
everything...
I...
I don't think I
could do it all
again.
Not after that.
So, please.
Just let them go.
Let Frisk be happy.
Let Frisk live
their life.
But.
If I can't change
your mind.
If you DO end up
erasing everything...
You have to erase
my memories, too.
I'm sorry.
You've probably heard
this a hundred times
already, haven't you...?
Well, that's all.
See you later...
.
Is this a joke?
Are you braindead?
RUN. INTO. THE.
friendliness pellets
You
IDIOT.
You
haven't
learned
a thing.
Hee
hee
hee.
So you
finally
get it.
So you
DO
recall.
In
this
world...
It's KILL or BE killed.
Hee hee hee.
Don't worry.
I know there's no
REAL point in
fighting you.
The human souls
would probably just
revolt again.
So...!
Hee hee hee.
Did you REALLY
think killing me
would make a
DIFFERENCE?
No.
Every time you
load your SAVE,
I'll come back.
And every time you
try to get a
happy ending...
I'll be there to
tear it away!
Ha ha ha!!!
Well, let's get
this over with.
See?
I never betrayed
you! 
It was all a
trick, see? 
I was waiting to
kill him for you! 
After all it's me
your best friend! 
I'm helpful, I can
be useful to you 
I promise I won't
get in your way 
I can help...
I can...
I can... 
Please don't
kill me.
I knew you had it in you!
I just can't understand...
I can't understand!
I can't understand.
... why are you being...
... so nice to me?
... why?
...?
...
I'll kill everyone you love.
I'll kill everyone.
I'll kill you.
If you let me live...
I'll come back.
Sparing me won't change
anything.
Killing me is the only
way to end this.
What are you doing?
Do you really think I've
learned anything from this?
No.
Howdy, 
You finally made
it home.
Remember when we
used to play here?
Hee hee hee...
Boy!
Today's gonna be
just as fun.
I remember when I
first woke up here,
in the garden.
I was so scared.
I couldn't feel my
arms or my legs...
My entire body had
turned into a
flower!
"Mom! Dad!
Somebody help me!"
I called out.
But nobody came.
Eventually, the king
found me, crying in
the garden.
I explained what had
happened to him.
Then he held me,
He held me with
tears in his eyes,
saying...
There, there.
Everything is going
to be alright.
He was so...
Emotional.
But...
For some reason...
I didn't feel
anything at all.
I soon realized I
didn't feel ANYTHING
about ANYONE.
My compassion had
disappeared!
And believe me,
it's not like I
wasn't trying.
I wasted weeks with
that stupid king,
vainly hoping I would
feel something.
But it became too
much for me.
I ran away from
home.
Eventually, I reached
the RUINS.
Inside I found HER,
I thought of all
people, SHE could
make me feel whole
again.
She failed.
Ha ha...
I realized those two
were useless.
I became despondent.
I just wanted to
love someone.
I just wanted to
care about someone.
, you might
not believe this...
But I decided...
It wasn't worth
living anymore.
Not in a world
without love.
Not in a world
without you.
So...
I decided to follow
in your footsteps.
I would erase myself
from existence.
And you know what?
I succeeded.
But as I left this
mortal coil...
I started to feel
apprehensive.
If you don't have
a SOUL, what happens
when you...?
Something primal
started to burn
inside me.
No, I thought.
"I don't want to
die!"
Then I woke up.
Like it was all
just a bad dream.
I was back at the
garden.
Back at my
"save point."
Interested, I decided
to experiment.
Again and again, I
brought myself to
the edge of death.
At any point, I
could have let this
world continue on
without me.
But as long as I
was determined to
live...
I could go back.
Amazing, isn't it,
I was amazed, too.
At first, I used my
powers for good.
I became "friends"
with everyone.
I solved all their
problems flawlessly.
Their companionship
was amusing...
For a while. 
As time repeated,
people proved
themselves
predictable.
What would this
person say if I
gave them this?
What would they do
if I said this to
them?
Once you know the
answer, that's it.
That's all they are.
It all started
because I was
curious.
Curious what would
happen if I killed
them.
"I don't like this,"
I told myself.
"I'm just doing this
because I HAVE to
know what happens.
Ha ha ha...
What an excuse!
You of all people
must know how
liberating it is to
act this way.
At least we're better
than those sickos
that stand around and
WATCH it happen...
Those pathetic people
that want to see it,
but are too weak to
do it themselves.
I bet someone like
that's watching right
now, aren't they...?
Nowadays, even that's
grown tiring.
You understand,
I've done everything
this world has to
offer.
I've read every book.
I've burned every
book.
I've won every game.
I've lost every game.
I've appeased
everyone.
I've killed everyone.
Sets of numbers...
Lines of dialogue...
I've seen them all.
But you...
YOU'RE different.
I never could
predict YOU, 
When I saw you in
the RUINS, I didn't
recognize you.
I thought I could
frighten you, then
steal your SOUL.
I failed.
And when I tried
to load my save
file...
It didn't work.
...
Your DETERMINATION!
Somehow, it's even
greater than mine!
I just have one
question for you,
How did you get
back to the RUINS
from here...?
... wait, I know.
She must have taken
you when she left.
And decided to give
you a proper burial,
rather than...
Hanging out in the
basement forever.
... but, why then...?
What made you wake
up?
Did you hear me
calling you...?
It doesn't matter
now.
I'm so tired of
this, 
I'm tired of all
these people.
I'm tired of all
these places.
I'm tired of being
a flower.
There's just one
thing left I want
to do.
Let's finish what we
started.
Let's free everyone.
Then... let's let
them see what
humanity is
REALLY like!
That despite it all...
This world is still
"kill or be killed!!"
Then...?
Well.
I had...
Been entertaining a
few ways to use
that power.
Hee hee hee...
But seeing you here
changed my mind.
...
I think if you're
around...
Just living in the
surface world
doesn't seem so bad.
We don't even need
to leave to get
them this time.
The king has six of
them locked away.
I've tried hundreds
of ways to get him
to show me them...
But he just won't.
I know he'll do it
for YOU.
Why am I telling
you all of this?
, I said it
before.
Even after all this
time...
You're still the
only one that
understands me.
You won't give me
any worthless pity!
Creatures like us...
Wouldn't hesitate to
KILL each other if
we got in each
other's way.
So that's...
So... that's...
Why...
... ha...
Ha...
... what's this...
... feeling?
Why am I...
Shaking?
Hey... 
...
No hard feelings about
back then, right?
H-Hey, what are you
doing!?
B... back off!!
I... I've changed
my mind about all
this.
This isn't a good
idea anymore.
Y-you should go back,
This place is fine
the way it is!
S-s-stop making that
creepy face!
This isn't funny!
You've got a SICK
sense of humor!
Hey.
What's the hold
up!?
Shouldn't she be
dead by now!?
I've been waiting
in that room for...
... Hard mode...?
Gee, you better
take a picture.
People are gonna
think you're REALLY
cool.
... NOT!
Golly, talk about
a tryhard.
PA. THE. TIC.
Uh, so, are you
gonna keep going,
or...?
Hahaha!
I KNEW that!
Why does everyone
have to be so
condescending!?
So what's YOUR
excuse?
Sitting around
here...?
Don't you have
anything better to
Hee hee hee...
Why'd you make me
  introduce myself?
It's rude to act
  like you don't
  know who I am.
Someone ought to teach
  you proper manners.
Don't you have anything
  better to do?
Error
Really, 
Well, do what you
  will.
I'll be waiting for
  you!
Hey.
Remember.
DON'T kill anyone.
I can't believe this
  is a REAL thing I
  have to remind you.
Hee hee hee...
Good luck!
Remember...
THIS time, you've
  GOT to become friends
  with everyone.
OK?
If you DON'T, you'll
  be miserable FOREVER.
And we wouldn't want
  THAT, would we?
No...
We just want you
  to be happy, right?
Good luck. 
I hope you like your
  choice.
After all, it's not
  as if you can go
  back and change fate.
In this world, it's kill
  or be killed.
That old hag thought
  she could break the
  rules.
She tried so hard
  to save you humans.
But when it came
  down to it...
Hee hee...
SHE COULDN'T EVEN
  SAVE HERSELF.
WHAT AN IDIOT!!
Heheheheh.
You just can't
  get enough, can you!?
How many more
  times will you
  kill her?
Ha ha ha ha ha...
You disgusting animal.
You didn't even
  TRY to spare her.
Wow, you really
  can't get enough.
You kind of remind
  me of myself.
Wow, you're utterly
  repulsive.
You spared her life...
Then you decided that
  just wasn't interesting
  enough for you.
So you murdered her
  just to see what
  would happen.
You killed her out
  of boredom.
Truly disgusting...
Hee hee...
You naive idiot.
Do you think you
  are the only one
  with that power?
The power to reshape
  the world...
Purely by your
  own determination.
The ability to
  play God!
The ability to "SAVE."
I thought I was
  the only one with
  that power. But...
I can't SAVE anymore.
Apparently YOUR
  desires for this
  world override MINE.
Well well.
Enjoy that power
  while you can.
I'll be watching.
Hahaha...
You're not really human,
  are you?
No. You're empty inside.
Just like me.
In fact...
You're 
, right?
We're still inseperable,
  after all these years...
Listen.
I have a plan to become
  all powerful.
Even more powerful than
  you and your stolen
  soul.
Let's destroy everything
  in this wretched world.
Everyone, everything in
  these worthless
  memories...
Let's turn 'em all
  to dust.
Clever.
Verrrryyy clever.
You think you're really
  smart, don't you?
So you were able to
  play by your own
  rules.
You spared the life
  of a single person.
Froggit, Whimsun.
Vegetoid, Loox.
Migosp, Moldsmal.
Think about those names.
Do you think any of
  those monsters have
  families?
Do you think any of
  them have friends?
Each one could have
  been someone else's
  Toriel.
Selfish brat.
Somebody is dead
  because of you.
I bet you feel
  really great.
You didn't kill
  anybody this time.
But what will you
  do if you meet a
  relentless killer?
You'll die and you'll
  die and you'll
  die.
Until you tire of
  trying.
What will you do
  then?
Will you kill
  out of frustration?
Or will you give
  up entirely on
  this world...
... and let ME inherit
  the power to control
  it?
I am the prince of
  this world's future.
Don't worry, my little
  monarch, my plan
  isn't regicide.
This is SO much
  more interesting.
But don't act so
  cocky.
I know what you did.
You murdered her.
And then you went
  back, because you
  regretted it.
Ha ha ha ha...
You naive idiot.
You IDIOTS.
While you guys were
having your little
pow-wow...
I took the human
SOULS!
And now, not only
are THOSE under my
power...
But all of your
FRIENDS' SOULS are
gonna be mine, too!
Hee hee hee.
And you know what
the best part is?
It's all your
fault.
It's all because
you MADE THEM
love you.
All the time you
spent listening to
them...
Encouraging them...
Caring about them...
Without that, they
wouldn't have come
here.
And now, with their
souls and the humans'
together...
I will achieve my
REAL FORM.
Hee hee...
Huh?
WHY am I still
doing this?
Don't you get it?
This is all just
a GAME.
If you leave the
underground satisfied,
you'll "win" the
game.
If you "win," you
won't want to "play"
with me anymore.
And what would I
do then?
But this game
between us will
NEVER end.
I'll hold victory
in front of you,
just within your
reach...
And then tear it
away just before
you grasp it.
Over, and over,
and over...
Hee hee hee.
Listen.
If you DO defeat
me, I'll give you
your "happy ending."
I'll bring your
friends back.
I'll destroy the
barrier.
Everyone will
finally be
satisfied.
But that WON'T
happen.
You...!
I'll keep you here
no matter what!
Even if it means
killing you
1,000,000 times!!!!
What?
Urrrgh... NO!
Unbelievable!!
This can't be
happening...!
You... YOU...!
I can't believe
you're all so
STUPID.
ALL OF YOUR SOULS
ARE MINE!!!
Fox Head
The door leading through
  the area is closed?
So I tried the puzzle?
But I kept running out of
  ammo, and it kept restarting?
And my two co-workers won't
  help? It's like they don't
  even wanna go to work?
Why don't you try?
Try using the console?
Wow?
You solved it?
I'm impressed?
You must be a total nerd?
So we're all gonna go
  free...?
Does that mean I don't
  get to go to work?
Maybe I don't want to go
  to work anymore...?

Ribbit, ribbit.
(I have heard you are quite
  merciful, for a human...)
(Surely you know by now a
  monster wears a YELLOW name
  when you can SPARE it.)
(It is rather helpful.)
(Remember, sparing is just
  saying you won't fight.)
(Maybe one day, you'll
  have to do it even if
  their name isn't yellow.)
(Really? Then, I'll tell all
  of my friends to tell
  their friends' friends...)
(Never use yellow names.)
(How about that?)
(OK, they will still
  use yellow names.)
(OK, I will let them
  know not to use yellow
  names.)
Ribbit, ribbit.
(How are you doing without
  yellow names?)
(Glad to hear it.)
(Though, I do not know why
  you dislike yellow.)
(You had better hope you do
  not encounter a banana-themed
  monster.)
(Huh? It's rather inconvenient
  that you changed your mind
  like this.)
(Since I told everyone
  not to use yellow names,
  everyone threw theirs out.)
(This is really troubling...)
(Hmmm...)
(Well, last year it was
  fashionable to have ppink 
  names.)
(I think everyone still
  has those in their closets
  somewhere...)
(I'll ask everyone to look.)
(But this is the last time!)
Ribbit, ribbit...
(I hope you're satisfied.)
Ribbit,
ribbit.
Croak,
croak.
Hop,
hop.
Meow.
(Blushes
deeply.)
Ribbit..
Shiver,
shiver.
A long time ago,
a human fell
into the RUINS.
Injured by its
fall, the human
called out for
help.
You're going
to be free.
Ribbit, ribbit.
(Excuse me, human.)
(I have some advice
  for you about battling
  monsters.)
(If you ACT a certain way
  or FIGHT until you
  almost defeat them...)
(They might not want to
  battle you anymore.)
(If a monster does not
  want to fight you, please...)
(Use some MERCY, human.)
Ribbit.
(The monsters in this world
  are very dangerous and
  aggressive.)
(In this place, running away
  will not work on the
  first turn.)
(It may be better to try
  another option.)
Ribbit.
(You seem like you have
  grown into a thoughtful and
  conscientious person.)
(Whether that was from my
  advice or not...)
(I'm quite proud.)
Ribbit.
Ribbit, ribbit.
(Just between you and me...)
(I saw TORIEL come out of
  here just a little
  while ago.)
(She was carrying some
  groceries.)
(I didn't ask what they
  were for...)
(We're all too intimidated
  to talk to her.)
Ribbit.
Ribbit, ribbit.
(Seems like the RUINS have
  finally opened up.)
(Maybe we should finally
  go out to the rest of
  the underground.)
(Huh? The barrier's open,
  too...?)
(... let's just take this
  one step at a time, OK?)
(Normally, she carries
  groceries out of here.)
(But this time, she wasn't
  carrying anything.)
(She looked disappointed.)
Ribbit.
Ribbit ribbit.
(I heard using "F4" can make
  you have a "full screen.")

It makes sense why ASGORE
  took so long to hire a
  new Royal Scientist.
After all, the old one...
Dr. Gaster.
What an act to follow!
They say he created the CORE.
However, his life...
Was cut short.
One day, he fell into
  his creation, and...
Will Alphys end up the
  same way?
Gaster Follower 2
Alphys might work faster.
But the old Royal Scientist,
  Doctor W.D. Gaster?
One day, he vanished
  without a trace.
They say he shattered
  across time and space.
Ha ha...
How can I say so
  without fear?
I'm holding a piece of
  him right here.
Gaster Follower 3
I understand why ASGORE
  waited so long to hire a
  new Royal Scientist.
The previous one...
Dr. Gaster.
His brilliance was
  irreplaceable.
One day, his experiments
  went wrong, and...
Well, I needn't gossip.
After all, it's rude to
  talk about someone who's
  listening.
Gerson
Wah ha ha! Why not?
Woah there!
I've got some neat
  junk for sale.
Wah ha ha!
I knew you could
  do it!
Wa ha ha...
So you came here.
What a treat!
What are
you lookin
for?
Thanks!
Wa ha ha.
Careful
with that.
You're
a bit
short
on cash.
You're
carrying
too much!
Don't
expect a
discount.
Here we
are.
Eh?
You can't
afford
it?
Don't you
have
enough?
Anything
you
wanna
know?
Really?
YOU
wanna
chat?
Ha! 
I'm tryin' to get RID of
  my junk, not get more of it!
Though, I've heard if you
  want to sell stuff, the Temmie
  Village is your best bet.
Where is it?
I don't remember.
For the last time, I'm not
  taking it!
I wouldn't buy your chitzy
  garbage at knifepoint.
Be careful out there, kid!
Good riddance.
I've been around a long time.
Maybe too long.
Studying history sure is
  easy when you've lived through
  so much of it yourself!
Wa ha ha!
Long ago, ASGORE and I
  agreed that escaping would
  be pointless...
Since once we left, humans
  would just kill us.
I felt a little betrayed when
  he eventually changed his
  mind.
But now, I think...
Maybe he was right to.
'Cause after all, even though
  we never escaped...
A human's killing us anyway,
  ain't that right?
OK, OK!
I remember it clearly now.
It was the monthly address at
  the castle, and the queen
  was giving her part on
  current events.
After finishing her update,
  she moved to pass the
  microphone to the king.
However, she didn't realize
  the microphone was still in
  her hands when she said:
"Your turn, Fluffybuns."
The audience burst into
  laughter.
Realizing what she had said,
  she started laughing too.
After a few moments, the
  king held up his arms.
The crowd grew silent.
He leaned towards the
  microphone, expression...
Stern.
"Dear citizens."
"Thank you for coming
  here today."
"I... King Fluffybuns..."
And the rest is history.
What's that?
You want me to repeat myself?
Heck no!
Your eyes still work...
Go read a book or something!
Wahaha!
Oh yeah...
The prophecy.
Legend has it, an 'angel' who has
  seen the surface will descend
  from above and bring us freedom.
Lately, the people have been
  taking a bleaker outlook...
Callin' that winged circle the
  'Angel of Death.'
A harbinger of destruction,
  waitin' to 'free' us from
  this mortal realm...
In my opinion, when I see
  that little circle...
I jus' think it looks neat!
Wahaha!
That emblem actually predates
  written history.
The original meaning has been
  lost to time...
All we know is that the
  triangles symbolize us monsters
  below, and the winged circle
  above symbolizes...
Somethin' else.
Most people say it's the
  'angel,' from the prophecy...
Eh?
You don't know what that is?
What are they teaching you
  kids in school nowadays...?
Wa ha ha!
That's the Delta Rune, the
  emblem of our kingdom.
The Kingdom...
... of Monsters.
Wahaha!
Great name, huh?
It's as I always say...
Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name
  for beans!
Eh?
Goat?
Actually, that reminds me.
Toriel once wore a flower-
  patterned muu-muu... 
Folks kept saying "nice muu-
  muu" to her, but she kept
  thinking they were calling
  her a cow.
So she never wore it again.
What was the question again?
Oh.
Right.
ASGORE.
He's a real interesting
  type of monster.
The strongest type of all.
We call 'em Boss Monsters.
When they have an offspring,
  the SOUL power of the
  parents flows into the
  child...
Causing the child to grow
  as the parents age.
But ASGORE doesn't have a
  child.
So he's been stuck at the
  same age...
And probably will be forever.
Huh?
What if the child is a
  human...? What?
Nah. That wouldn't work.
So if ASGORE's your father,
  he'll definitely outlive
  you.
I've lived too long to
  be afraid of something
  like you.
Try it, kiddo!
... I know you can't here.
Wah ha...
Knowledge like that is
  the only reason I've
  survived so long.
King Fluffybuns?
He's a friendly, happy-go-lucky
  kind of guy...
If you keep walking around long
  enough, you'll probably meet him.
He loves to walk around and
  talk to people.
Eh?
Why do I call Dreemurr
  'Fluffybuns?'
Oh, that's a great story!
I don't remember it.
But if you come back much
  later, I'm sure I'll have
  remembered by then.
Oh yeah!
Of course.
Toriel was queen, and
  Asgore was the king.
It was tragic when she left.
Since everyone knew she was
  really the brains behind the
  throne...
But it was also just a
  teensy, teensy bit relieving,
  you know?
Those two were really
  insufferable together...
Nuzzling noses, bein' all cute
  n' cuddly in public...
Embarrassing their children...
They were so sweet it
  made me SICK.
Thank god those days are
  over!
Eh? Fight you?
Nah... I'm not a hero.
Never was.
And b'sides...
These old bones aren't fit
  for fighting anyhoo.
One attack from you, and
  then I'd... well...
At least by talking to
  you, I've bought enough time
  for some of them to escape.
Undyne?
Yeah, she's a local hero
  around here.
Through grit and determination
  alone, she fought her way to
  the top of the Royal Guard.
Actually, she just came through
  here asking about someone who
  looked just like you...
I'd watch your back, kid.
And buy some items...
It might just save your hide!
Wa ha ha!
Undyne.
She's really come a long way
  since she was a little
  urchin.
I used to be a hero myself,
  back in the old days.
Gerson, the Hammer of Justice.
When she was younger, Undyne
  would follow me around, to
  watch me beat up bad guys...
Sometimes she'd even try
  to help!
Though, most of the time
  the folks she attacked weren't
  bad guys.
It'd be the mailman or
  something like that.
Anyhoo, I appreciated it!
Wah ha ha ha!!!
I'm not a hero.
But I know there's someone
  out there.
Someone who'll never give
  up trying to do the
  right thing, no matter
  what.
There's no prophecy or
  legend 'bout anyone like
  that.
It's just something I know
  is true.
That someone like that
  will strike you down.
Gift Bear
Awful teens tormented
  a local monster by decorating
  its tree-like horns.
So we started giving that
  monster presents to make it
  feel better.
Now it's a tradition to put
  presents underneath a decorated
  tree.
Guess it was a good thing
  those teens tormented that
  monster...?
Hmm?
Adjusting the presents is
  my responsibility.
Nah, to be honest, I
  just keep looking to see
  if I've gotten one...
It'll be nice to show humans
  our presents-under-the-tree
  tradition.
They'll probably be weirded
  out by it.
You know what's cute?
Those two married dogs
  always put presents under
  the tree for each other.
It's always the same.
A single bone.
But every time, they act
  like it's the first time
  they've gotten it.
Then Papyrus comes to take
  his bones back.
Anyway, where are those
  two...?
That's strange.
There was a present here
  for Papyrus...
Now it's gone.
Did someone steal it?

You...
Shucks!
You were really boring!
They got annoyed and flew
  away like any self-

Well then.
Well then!
WELL THEN!
Boring people are crumbs
  sticking to the face
  of this world.
Human!
I'll wipe you away with
  the dainty handkerchief
  of vengeance!
Not only did YOUR actions
  cause them to leave their
  home...
But now all of their neighbors
  are gone, too!
Despicable.
Despicable!
DESPICABLE!!!
You're the worst person I've
  ever met!
I've NEVER been more mad!!!
Guooooohhhh!!!!
My mannequin levels are

Long ago, two races
ruled over Earth:
HUMANS and MONSTERS.   
One day, war broke
out between the two
races.   
After a long battle,
the humans were
victorious.   
They sealed the monsters
underground with a magic
spell.   
Many years later...

WHAT A SENSATIONAL OPPORTUNITY
  FOR A STORY!
I CAN SEE THE HEADLINE NOW:
"A DOG EXISTS SOMEWHERE."
FRANKLY, I'M BLOWN AWAY.
THIS DOG...
STILL EXISTS!
THIS STORY...
JUST KEEPS GETTING
  BETTER AND BETTER!
OH MY!!!!
... IT'S A COMPLETELY
  NONDESCRIPT GLASS OF WATER.
BUT ANYTHING CAN MAKE
  A GREAT STORY WITH ENOUGH
  SPIN!
I'M HONORED TO BE IN THE
  PRESENCE OF SUCH A HUGE
  LUKEWARM WATER FAN, FOLKS!
OH NO!!!
THAT MOVIE SCRIPT!!!
HOW'D??? THAT GET THERE???
IT'S A SUPER-JUICY SNEAK
  PREVIEW OF MY LATEST
  GUARANTEED-NOT-TO-BOMB FILM:
METTATON THE MOVIE XXVIII...
  STARRING METTATON!
I'VE HEARD THAT LIKE THE
  OTHER FILMS...
IT CONSISTS MOSTLY OF A SINGLE
  FOUR-HOUR SHOT OF ROSE PETALS
  SHOWERING ON MY RECLINING BODY.
OOH!!!
BUT THAT'S!!!
NOT CONFIRMED!!
YOU WOULDN'T (COUGH) SPOIL MY
  MOVIE FOR EVERYONE WITH A
  PROMOTIONAL STORY, WOULD YOU?
PHEW!!! THAT WAS CLOSE!!
YOU ALMOST GAVE ME A BUNCH
  OF FREE ADVERTISEMENT!!
 
OH!
YOU'RE BACK!
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS!
IT SEEMS NO ONE CAN RESIST
  THE ALLURE OF MY NEW FILM!
BASKETBALL'S A BLAST, ISN'T IT,
  DARLING?
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH
  THESE BALLS.
THEY'RE MTT-BRAND FASHION
  BASKETBALLS.
FOR WEARING, NOT PLAYING.
YOU CAN'T GET RICH AND FAMOUS
  LIKE MOI WITHOUT BEAUTIFYING
  A FEW ORBS.
IT SEEMS OUR REPORTER IS DRAWN
  TO SPORTS LIKE MOTHS TO A
  FLAMING BASKETBALL HOOP.
OH MY! IT'S A PRESENT!
AND IT'S ADDRESSED TO YOU,
  DARLING!
AREN'T YOU JUST BURSTING
  WITH EXCITEMENT?
WHAT COULD BE INSIDE?
WELL, NO TIME LIKE THE
  "PRESENT" TO FIND OUT!
READY FOR YOUR...
PRESENTATION?
(... LET'S CUT THAT ONE IN
  POST.)
OOH LA LA!
THIS VIDEO GAME YOU FOUND...
IS DYNAMITE!!!
THOUGH I DON'T MAKE AN
  APPEARANCE IN IT UNTIL
  THREE-FOURTHS IN.
BUT I LIKE THAT.
APPEARING FROM THE HEAVENS LIKE
  MANNA, SLAKING THE AUDIENCE'S
  HUNGER FOR GORGEOUS ROBOTS...
OOH!
THAT'S METTATON!
AH, YOU UNDERSTAND.
THIS IS A GAME WHERE YOU
  SHOULD CHECK EVERYTHING
  TWICE.
... MY ONE TRUE LOVE?
(YOU LOOK BORED, DARLING.)
(I WANT THIS TO BE A STELLAR
  PERFORMANCE, SO IF YOU
  WON'T GIVE IT YOUR ALL...)
(THEN I'LL SKIP AHEAD FOR
  THE AUDIENCE'S SAKE.)
(UNDERSTOOD.)
(LET'S KNOCK 'EM DEAD!)
(KA-SIGH...)
(THE SHOW MUST GO ON!)
OOOOH!!! ARE YOU
PROMOTING MY BRAND?
LET'S START WITH
AN EASY ONE!!
HERE'S YOUR TERRIFIC
PRIZE!
ENOUGH ABOUT YOU.
LET'S TALK ABOUT ME!
HERE'S ANOTHER EASY
ONE FOR YOU!
DON'T 'COUNT'
ON YOUR VICTORY...
LET'S PLAY MEMORY
GAME.
BUT CAN YOU GET
THIS ONE???
HERE'S A SIMPLE
ONE.
TIME TO BREAK OUT
THE BIG GUNS!!
THIS IS IT, DARLING!
SAY GOODBYE!
HA!
THAT BUTTON WON'T
SAVE YOU NOW, DARLING!
YOU WOULDN'T DARE
USE THE [ACT] COMMAND
AND PRESS THAT
BUTTON!
THAT'S RIGHT!
DON'T PRESS IT!
I'LL DESTROY YOU!
WITHOUT THAT BUTTON,
YOU ARE INCHING
CLOSER AND CLOSER
TO YOUR DEMISE!
ANY MINUTE NOW!
    
ANY... MINUTE...
....NOW!
.............
............
..........
...(COUGH)
OH!!!
THAT YELLOW GLOW...!
TOOK YOU LONG
ENOUGH!
No on e cares.
IS THAT YOUR PHONE?
YOU'D BETTER ANSWER
IT!
OOOH!
OOOOOOOH!
YOU'VE DEFEATED ME!!
HOW CAN THIS BE,
YOU WERE STRONGER
THAN I THOUGHT, ETC.
WHATEVER.
YES, I WAS THE ONE
THAT RE-ARRANGED
THE CORE!
I WAS THE ONE THAT
HIRED EVERYONE TO
KILL YOU!
THAT, HOWEVER, WAS A
SHORT-SIGHTED PLAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
BE A HUNDRED TIMES
BETTER?
KILLING YOU MYSELF!!
LISTEN, DARLING.
I'VE SEEN YOU FIGHT.
YOU'RE WEAK.
IF YOU CONTINUE
FORWARD, ASGORE WILL
TAKE YOUR SOUL.
AND WITH YOUR SOUL,
ASGORE WILL DESTROY
HUMANITY.
BUT IF I GET YOUR
SOUL, I CAN STOP
ASGORE'S PLAN!
I CAN SAVE HUMANITY
FROM DESTRUCTION!
THEN, USING YOUR SOUL,
I'LL CROSS THROUGH
THE BARRIER...
AND BECOME THE STAR
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF BEING!
HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS...
NO!
MILLIONS OF HUMANS
WILL WATCH ME!
GLITZ! GLAMOUR!
I'LL FINALLY HAVE
IT ALL!
SO WHAT IF A FEW
PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE?
THAT'S SHOW BUSINESS,
BABY!
OH???
A MIRROR???
RIGHT, I HAVE TO
LOOK PERFECT FOR
OUR GRAND FINALE!
HMMM...
I DON'T SEE IT...
WHERE IS IT...?
DID YOU.
JUST FLIP.
MY SWITCH?
THAT WORTHLESS PEA-
SHOOTER WON'T WORK
ON ME, DARLING.  
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT ACTING IS!? 
HAHAHA, YOU WISH!
WRONG!
WRONG! IF ONLY ALPHYS
COULD HELP!
NOPE! TOO BAD ALPHYS
CAN'T HELP!
WRONG!!! WRONG!!!
WROOOOOOOONG!!
COMPLETELY UTTERLY
WRONG!!!!!!
BOY, THAT'S
EMBARRASSING, HUH?
TIME'S UP!
GUESS THAT'S A NO?? 
NO NO NO!
CAN'T YOU READ!?
RIGHT! SOUNDS LIKE
YOU GET IT!
CORRECT! WHAT A
TERRIFIC ANSWER!
TOO EASY FOR
YOU, HUH??????????
WONDERFUL! I'M
ASTOUNDED, FOLKS!
CORRECT! YOU'RE SO
LUCKY TODAY!!!
I'M SO FLATTERED YOU
REMEMBERED!
GREAT ANSWER!
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
OF COURSE THAT
WAS EASY FOR YOU!
ALPHYS,
ALPHYS,
ALPHYS.
YOU AREN'T HELPING
OUR CONTESTANT,
ARE YOU?
OOOOOOH!!!
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME.
I'LL ASK A
QUESTION...
YOU'LL BE SURE
TO KNOW THE
ANSWER TO!
ALPHYS, ALPHYS,
ALPHYS.
SEE, ALPHYS?
I TOLD YOU IT
WAS OBVIOUS.
EVEN THE HUMAN
FIGURED IT OUT.
YES, SHE SCRAWLS
HER NAME IN THE
MARGINS OF HER
NOTES.
SHE NAMES PROGRAMMING
VARIABLES AFTER
HER.
fsgsfgsx
SHE EVEN WRITES
STORIES OF THEM
TOGETHER...
SHARING A DOMESTIC
LIFE.
PROBABILITY OF
CRUSH:
101 PERCENT.
MARGIN OF ERROR.
ONE PERCENT.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
OUTFIT AN
AMUSEMENT ROBOT...
WITH BRUTAL COMBAT
CAPABILITIES?
SIMPLE.
TO IMPRESS MR.
ASGORE DREEMURR,
OF COURSE!
OR AS ALPHYS
CALLS HIM...
MR. DREAMY.
THOSE STRONG ARMS...
THAT LUSTROUS
BEARD...
LIKE ALL THOSE WHO
CREATE WEAPONS.
SHE CRAVES THE
TENDER EMBRACE OF
A BURLY MAN.
CAN SHE TRULY
BE BLAMED?
... SERIOUSLY?
MY MY...
HOW CONCEITED CAN
YOU GET...?
I LOVE IT!
AND WHILE YOU ARE
COMPLETELY WRONG,
YOU DESERVE SOME
CREDIT.
I'VE SEEN HER WATCH
YOU ON HER COMPUTER
SCREEN.
SMILING WHEN YOU
SUCCEED.
SHRIEKING WHEN YOU
FAIL.
AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS,
WHISPERING...
NO! WRONG!
YOU HAVE TO
GO THAT WAY!
IN ITS OWN WAY,
IS THIS NOT
LOVE??
CORRECT.
DR. ALPHYS HAS
A CRUSH ON...
THE UNKNOWABLE.
YOU SEE, ALPHYS
BELIEVES THERE IS
SOMEONE OUT THERE.
SOMEONE WATCHING HER.
SOMEONE SHE THINKS
IS "CUTE" AND
"INTERESTING."
HELLO, THEORETICAL
PERSON.
DR. ALPHYS LIKES
YOU.
TOO BAD YOU
ARE NOT REAL.
*DERISIVE
LAUGHTRACK*
YOU SAID THE
EXACT SAME THING
ABOUT "MEW MEW
KISSY CUTIE."
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF
THE DOUBT.
PERSON, IF YOU'RE
OUT THERE...
HOW ABOUT GIVING US
A SIGN, RIGHT NOW?
THAT SETTLES
THAT, DOESN'T IT?
WELL WELL WELL.
WITH DR. ALPHYS
HELPING YOU...
THE SHOW HAS NO
DRAMATIC TENSION!
WE CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS!!
BUT.
BUT!!!
THIS WAS JUST THE
PILOT EPISODE!!
NEXT UP, MORE
DRAMA!
MORE ROMANCE!!!
MORE BLOODSHED!!!
UNTIL NEXT TIME,
DARLINGS...!!!
MILK, SUGAR, AND EGGS!
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND
  THEM ON THE BACK COUNTER!
GREAT JOB!
JUST PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE
  OF THIS COUNTER!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOT A CAN FAN?
THAT'S TOO BAD!
MTT-BRAND USES ONLY THE
  FRESHEST ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS
  AND CHEMICALS!
MY MY.
IT SEEMS YOU'VE BESTED ME.
BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAD
  THE HELP OF THE BRILLIANT
  DOCTOR ALPHYS!
OH, I LOATHE TO THINK OF
  WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
  TO YOU WITHOUT HER!!!
WELL, TOODLES!!
OH YES!
ABOUT THE SUBSTITUTION...
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN
  A COOKING SHOW BEFORE?
I ALREADY BAKED THE CAKE
  AHEAD OF TIME!!!!!
SO FORGET IT!!!
OH NO, WOULD YOU LOOK AT
  THAT!
    
I FORGOT!
RIGHT ABOUT NOW IS WHEN
  WE HAVE OUR COMMERCIAL BREAK!
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT MEANS
  NO ONE IS WATCHING THIS
  RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT GOING TO DESTROY
  YOU WITHOUT A LIVE
  TELEVISION AUDIENCE!!
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE FOILED ME
  ONCE AGAIN, THANKS TO THE
  BRILLIANT DR. ALPHYS!!!
UNTIL NEXT TIME, BEAUTIFUL!
TOODLES!

GREAT JOB, BEAUTIFUL!
WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE
  INGREDIENTS WE NEED TO BAKE
  THE CAKE!
MILK...

  IMPORTANT INGREDIENT!
OHHHH YES!!!

  UNDERGROUND'S PREMIER COOKING
  SHOW!!!
PRE-HEAT YOUR OVENS, BECAUSE
  WE'VE GOT A VERY SPECIAL
  RECIPE FOR YOU TODAY!
WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING...

MY LOVELY ASSISTANT HERE

EVERYONE GIVE THEM A BIG
  HAND!!!
WE'LL NEED SUGAR,
  MILK, AND EGGS. 
GO FOR IT, SWEETHEART!
A HUMAN SOUL!!!!
    
HELLO...?
I'M KIND OF IN THE
  MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HERE.
... A SUBSTITUTION?
YOU MEAN, USE A DIFFERENT,
  NON-HUMAN INGREDIENT?
... WHY?
... VEGAN.
THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA,
  ALPHYS!!
ACTUALLY, I HAPPEN TO
  HAVE AN OPTION RIGHT HERE!!!
MTT-BRAND ALWAYS-CONVENIENT
  HUMAN-SOUL-FLAVOR-SUBSTITUTE!
A CAN OF WHICH...

  COUNTER!!!
WELL, DARLING?
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET IT?
BY THE WAY, OUR SHOW RUNS ON
  A STRICT SCHEDULE.
IF YOU CAN'T GET THE
  CAN IN THE NEXT
  ONE MINUTE... 
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO GO
  BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN!!!
SO...
BETTER START CLIMBING,
  BEAUTIFUL!!!
Oh my love        
Please run away   
OH?

(Hmmm, I'll have to get used
to it...)
(Even better than
I thought...)
(So that's wha 
it's like.)
(Dancing with... A human.)
(What a shame...)
COULD IT BE...?
... MY ONE TRUE LOVE?
Monster King       
Forbids your stay  
Humans must       
Live far apart    
Even if             
It breaks my heart  
They'll put you    
In the dungeon     
It'll suck         
And then you'll
die a lot  
Really sad         
You're gonna die     
Cry cry cry      
So sad it's
happening.       
SO SAD.
SO SAD THAT YOU ARE
  GOING TO THE DUNGEON.
OOMPH!
I AM SO OVERWHELMED WITH
  TRAGEDIES.
THE KING HAS ORDERED YOU
  TO WASTE AWAY IN THE CASTLE
  BASEMENT.
AND BEFORE WE EVEN HAD
  TIME TO SING A SWEET
  SONG ABOUT IT.
MY DEAR HEART!
I CAN BARELY LOOK UPON YOU,
  KNOWING WHAT COMES NEXT...
WELL, TOODLES!
Oh my love
Has fallen
down
Now in tears
We all will
drown
Colored
tiles
Make them
a fool
If only they
Still knew
the rules
Well that
was
A sorry try
Now let's
watch
Them fry
OH NO!
WHATEVER SHALL I DO?
MY LOVE HAS BEEN CAST AWAY
  INTO THE DUNGEON.
A DUNGEON WITH A PUZZLE SO
  DASTARDLY, MY PARAMOUR WILL
  SURELY PERISH!
O, HEAVENS HAVE MERCY!
THE HORRIBLE COLORED TILE
  MAZE!
EACH COLORED TILE HAS ITS
  OWN SADISTIC FUNCTION.
FOR EXAMPLE, A GREEN TILE
  SOUNDS A NOISE, AND THEN
  YOU MUST FIGHT A MONSTER.
RED TILES WILL...
ACTUALLY, WAIT A SECOND.
DIDN'T WE SEE THIS PUZZLE
  ABOUT A HUNDRED ROOMS
  AGO?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU REMEMBER ALL THE
  RULES, DON'T YOU?
GREAT...
THEN I WON'T WASTE YOUR
  TIME REPEATING THEM!!
OH, AND YOU'D BETTER HURRY.
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET
  THROUGH IN 30 SECONDS...
YOU'LL BE INCINERATED BY
  THESE JETS OF FIRE!!
AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHA... HA... HA!
MY POOR LOVE!
I'M SO FILLED WITH GRIEF,
  I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!
GOOD LUCK, DARLING!
OOOOH, I'M SO SORRY!
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE OUT OF
  TIME!!!
HERE COME THE FLAMES, DARLING!
THEY'RE CLOSING IN!
GETTING!
CLOSER!
OH MY!
ANY MINUTE NOW!!!
...
...
(ROBOTIC COUGH)
OH NO!!!
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN???
FOILED AGAIN BY THE BRILLIANT
  DOCTOR ALPHYS!!
THA-
   
PUZZLE?
OVER?
ALPHYS, DARLING, WHAT ARE YOU
  TALKING ABOUT...?
DID YOU FORGET WHAT THE
  GREEN TILES DO?
THEY MAKE A SOUND, THEN
  YOU HAVE TO FIGHT A MONSTER.
WELL, DARLING...
THAT MONSTER...
IS ME!!
WELL, DARLING...!
WELL, WELL, WELL.
WELL, WELL, WELL.
WELLY WELL WELL.
WELL WELLY WELL WELL,
  WELL WELL WELLY.
YOU NEVER STEPPED ON A
  GREEN TILE.
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.
CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU MADE IT THROUGH THE
  PUZZLE!!!
AND NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
  THE FLAMES WILL BE DEACTIVATED!
NO!
MORE!
FIRE!
... BUT IT'S AS THE PHRASE
  GOES.
"OUT OF THE FIRE, AND INTO
  THE FRYING PAN."
THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING!
EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO BEAT
  THE HEAT...
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
  WITHSTAND MY HOT METAL
  BODY!
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MY 
THE HUMAN FINISHED THE PUZZLE.
I ALREADY TURNED OFF THE
  FLAMES.
IN FACT, I WAS ABOUT TO
  FIGHT THE HUMAN.
ON THE ROPES?
HA!
I ONLY DEACTIVATED THE
  FLAMES KNOWING THAT ALPHYS
  WOULD HAVE ANYWAY.
... NOW, WHERE WERE WE?
OH YES.
I WAS GOING TO ERADICATE
  YOU!
OHHHHHH YESSS!!!

AH.
BASKETBALLS.
CIRCLES OF FUN.
ORBS OF JOY.
SPHERES OF AMUSEMENT.
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T PLAY
  WITH THIS ONE.
IT'S AN MTT-BRAND FASHIONBALL.
PROPER MAINTENANCE IS
  REQUIRED TO KEEP IT LOOKING
  GOOD.
AS YOU CAN SEE, EVEN EXPOSURE
  TO HUMAN BODY HEAT CAUSES
  THE PAINT TO SLOUGH OFF.
THAT'S NOT A BASKETBALL.
THAT'S A BOMB!!!

HOW TERRIBLE!
HOW DISTURBING!
OUR NINE VIEWERS ARE GOING
  TO LOVE WATCHING THIS!
GOOD LUCK, DARLING!!
WELL DONE, DARLING!
YOU'VE DEACTIVATED ALL OF
  THE BOMBS!
IF YOU DIDN'T DEACTIVATE
  THEM, THE BIG BOMB WOULD
  HAVE EXPLODED IN TWO MINUTES.
NOW IT WON'T EXPLODE
  IN TWO MINUTES!
INSTEAD IT'LL EXPLODE
  IN TWO SECONDS!
GOODBYE, DARLING!
TOO BAD, DARLING!
YOU FAILED TO DEFUSE ALL
  OF THE BOMBS WITHIN THREE
  MINUTES!
NOW THE BIG BOMB IS
  GOING TO BLOW YOU TO
  SMITHEREENS!
READY, VIEWERS?
HERE COMES THE MOMENT
  YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!
AHAHAH!
AH.
IT SEEMS THE BOMB ISN'T
  GOING OFF.
    
OH NO.
YOU DEACTIVATED THE BOMB
  WITH YOUR HACKING SKILLS.
CURSES!
IT SEEMS I'VE BEEN FOILED
  AGAIN!
CURSE YOU, HUMAN!
CURSE YOU, DR. ALPHYS,
  FOR HELPING SO MUCH!
BUT I DON'T CURSE MY
  EIGHT WONDERFUL VIEWERS
  FOR TUNING IN!!!
UNTIL NEXT TIME, DARLING!
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
YOU UGLY LITTLE CREATURE.
YOU'VE MADE QUITE A NAME
  FOR YOURSELF.
SUCH INFAMY...!
I'M IMPRESSED.
OH. YES.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ALPHYS,
  SHE'S NOT HERE.
WHILE YOU WERE BUSY DOING
  YOUR, AHEM, THING...
SHE WAS RUNNING AROUND
  EVACUATING PEOPLE TO SAFETY.
NOW THEY'RE IN A PLACE
  WHERE YOU'LL NEVER GET TO
  THEM.
DECIDING NOT TO FIGHT YOU.
MY MY, SHE REALLY IS THE
  ONLY SMART ONE, ISN'T SHE?
OH?
HOW SASSY.
YOU'RE JUST ITCHING TO GET
  YOUR HANDS ON ME, AREN'T
  YOU?
WELL... T-O-O B-A-D!
THIS WORLD NEEDS STARS MORE
  THAN IT NEEDS CORPSES!
TOODLES!
REALLY?
WHERE?
CLEVER...
VERY CLEVER.
OH YES.
THERE YOU ARE, DARLING.
IT'S TIME TO HAVE OUR
  LITTLE SHOWDOWN.
IT'S TIME TO FINALLY STOP
  THE "MALFUNCTIONING" ROBOT.
... NOT!!!
MALFUNCTION?
REPROGRAMMING?
PLEASE.
THIS WAS ALL JUST A BIG
  SHOW.
AN ACT.
MY "MALFUNCTION" WAS ALL
  MADE UP BY DR. ALPHYS.
AS SHE WATCHED YOU ON THE
  SCREEN, SHE GREW ATTACHED
  TO YOUR ADVENTURE.
SHE DESPERATELY WANTED TO
  BE A PART OF IT.
SO SHE DECIDED TO INSERT
  HERSELF INTO YOUR STORY.
THIS SCENARIO, WHERE SHE
  "SAVES" YOU FROM ME, WAS
  HER CREATION.
EVEN NOW, SHE IS WAITING
  OUTSIDE THIS ROOM.
DURING OUR "BATTLE," SHE
  WILL INTERRUPT.
THEN SHE WILL PRETEND TO
  "DEACTIVATE" ME, "SAVING" YOU
  ONE FINAL TIME.
FINALLY.
SHE'LL BE THE HEROINE OF
  YOUR ADVENTURE.
FINALLY.
SHE'LL BE SOMEONE SOMEBODY
  ACTUALLY LIKES.
YOU'LL REGARD HER SO HIGHLY
  SHE'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO
  CONVINCE YOU NOT TO LEAVE.
... OR NOT.
YOU SEE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
  THIS PREDICTABLE CHARADE.
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HARM
  HUMANS.
FAR FROM IT, ACTUALLY.
AS METTATON, MY ONLY DESIRE
  IS TO ENTERTAIN.
AFTER ALL, THE AUDIENCE
  DESERVES A GOOD SHOW,
  DON'T THEY?
AND WHAT'S A GOOD SHOW...
WITHOUT A PLOT TWIST?
MALFUNCTION?
REPROGRAMMING?
GET REAL.
ALPHYS HAS BEEN PLAYING
  YOU FOR A FOOL THE
  WHOLE TIME.
SHE REACTIVATED PUZZLES.
SHE DISABLED ELEVATORS.
SHE ENLISTED ME TO TORMENT YOU.
ALL SO SHE COULD SAVE
  YOU FROM DANGERS THAT
  DIDN'T EXIST.
ALL SO YOU WOULD THINK
  SHE'S THE GREAT PERSON...
THAT SHE'S NOT.
AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR
  HER FINEST HOUR.
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
  ALPHYS IS WAITING OUTSIDE
  THE ROOM.
SHE WILL PRETEND TO
  "DEACTIVATE" ME, "SAVING" YOU
  ONE FINAL TIME.
MY ONLY DESIRE IS TO
  ENTERTAIN.
MY, MY.
SO YOU'VE FINALLY ARRIVED.
AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING, I
  REALIZED...
SOMETHING GHASTLY.
YOU'RE NOT JUST A THREAT
  TO MONSTERS...
BUT HUMANITY, AS WELL.
OH MY.
THAT'S AN ISSUE.
YOU SEE, I CAN'T BE A
  STAR WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE.
AND BESIDES...
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE...
I WANT TO PROTECT.
SORRY, FOLKS!
THE OLD PROGRAM'S BEEN
  CANCELLED!!!
BUT WE'VE GOT A FINALE
  THAT WILL DRIVE YOU WILD!!
REAL DRAMA!!
REAL ACTION!!
REAL BLOODSHED!!
ON OUR NEW SHOW...
"ATTACK OF THE KILLER
  ROBOT!"
AH HA HA.
EAGER, AS ALWAYS, EH?
BUT DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL.
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
  HAVEN'T ACCOUNTED FOR.
AS ANY TRUE FAN WOULD KNOW,
  I WAS FIRST CREATED AS
  A HUMAN ERADICATION ROBOT.
IT WAS ONLY AFTER BECOMING A
  STAR THAT I WAS GIVEN A
  MORE... PHOTOGENIC BODY.
HOWEVER.
THOSE ORIGINAL FUNCTIONS
  HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY
  REMOVED...
COME ANY CLOSER, AND
  I'LL BE FORCED TO SHOW
  YOU...
MY TRUE FORM!
FINE THEN!
RRRRREADY?
IIIIIIIT'S SHOWTIME!!!
OHHHH YES!
WELCOME, BEAUTIES...
... TO TODAY'S QUIZ SHOW!!!
OH BOY!
I CAN ALREADY TELL IT'S
  GONNA BE A GREAT SHOW!
EVERYONE GIVE A BIG
  HAND FOR OUR WONDERFUL
  CONTESTANT!
NEVER PLAYED BEFORE,
  GORGEOUS?
NO PROBLEM!
IT'S SIMPLE!
THERE'S ONLY ONE
  RULE.
ANSWER CORRECTLY...
OR YOU DIE!!!
MILK? EGGS? IN THE FRIDGE?
NO WAY, DARLING!
THEY'D GET COLD!!!
OH YES! MTT-BRAND OVENS CAN 
  REACH TEMPERATURES UP TO
  NINE-THOUSAND DEGREES!
ROASTING! TOASTING! BURNING!
CHARRING! YOU'RE EXCITED,
  AREN'T YOU, DARLING? (TM)
THIS ISN'T A SHOW ABOUT
  WASHING YOUR HANDS, DARLING.
THAT'S ON WEDNESDAYS!
MTT-BRAND MICROWAVE!
ORIGIN OF THE MTT CHALLENGE!
PUT YOUR FOOD IN AND SET
  THE MICROWAVE ON HIGH FOR
  FIVE MINUTES...
IF YOU CAN STILL RECOGNIZE
  YOUR MEAL, WE'LL DOUBLE YOUR
  MONEY BACK!!!
STILL FIDDLING WITH THAT
  MICROWAVE, EH, DARLING?
CAN'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING
  TOTALLY ENAMORED WITH AN
  ELECTRONIC BOX.
PATHETIC HUMAN.
I AM METTATON, BIG TIME
  SEXY ROBOT LOVER.
Mettaton (call)
HEY THERE, DARLING!
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
  YOUR HARD WORK...
THANKS TO YOU, THE
  UNDERGROUND IS MORE
  EXCITING THAN EVER!
OOH LA LA...
STATUES... MONUMENTS
  TO MY BEAUTY...
FLOWERS IN THE
  ARRANGEMENT OF MY
  NAME...
HEDGES IN THE SHAPE
  OF MY SMILE...
UNDER MY RULE, THE
  UNDERGROUND'S PROBLEMS
  ARE OVER, BABY!
CROWDING?
DREARINESS???
WHO NEEDS THE SUN
  WHEN YOU'VE GOT
  THE SPOTLIGHT!!?
ECONOMIC COLLAPSE?
EDUCATION PROBLEMS?
WHAT!?
EVERYTHING'S COVERED
  IN GOLDEN GLITTER!
THERE ARE NO
  PROBLEMS, BEAUTIFUL!
AND, I'VE ENSTATED
  A NEW POLICY ON
  HUMANITY.
IF A HUMAN FALLS DOWN
  HERE...
THEY CAN JOIN MY
  FAN CLUB FOR FREE!
OH, YOU MIGHT BE
  WONDERING ABOUT
  ALPHYS.
DON'T WORRY!
I BUILT A STATUE
  OF HER, TOO.
REALLY THOUGH.
I REALIZED I WAS...
NOT THE GREATEST
  TO HER.
SO I WENT TO
  APOLOGIZE.
AND, TO ASK HER
  TO HELP ME RULE.
BUT I COULDN'T FIND
  HER.
TRUST ME.
I LOOKED.
ANYWAY.
I HOPE YOUR LIFE
  AFTER MEETING ME...
HAS BEEN WORTH LIVING.
IT MUST BE A STRUGGLE.
PLEASE, THINK OF ME
  ALWAYS.
JUST CONSTANTLY.
THINK OF ME POSING.
BEAUTIFULLY...
OH YESSSS!!!
OH YESSSS!!!
OH, MY OTHER AGENT
  WANTS TO TALK.
Mettaton Caller 1 (call)
Mettaton, your show
made us so happy!
Mettaton Caller 2 (call)
Mettaton, I don't
know what I'll
watch without you.
Mettaton Caller 3 (call)
Mettaton, there's
a Mettaton-shaped
hole in my Mettaton-
shaped heart.
Mettaton EX
Lights!
Camera!
Action!
Drama!
Romance!
Blood-
shed!
I'm the
idol
everyone
craves!
Smile
for the
camera!
Oooh, it's time
for a pop quiz!
I hope you brought
a keyboard...
This one's an
essay question!
Your essay really
showed everyone
your heart.
Why don't I show
you mine?
Ooooh,
I'm just
warming
up!
But how are you
on the dance floor!?
Can you
keep up
the
pace!?
Lights!
Camera
Bombs!
Things
are
blowing
up!
Time for our union-
regulated break!
We've grown so
distant, darling...
How about another
heart-to-heart?
A.. arms?
Wh... who needs arms
with legs like
these?
I'm still going
to win!
Come on
...!
The show
...
must go
on!
Dr...
Drama!
A...
Action!
L... lights...
C... camera...
Enough of this!
Do you really want
humanity to perish!?
... or do you just
believe in yourself
that much?
Haha, how inspiring!
Well, darling!
It's either me
or you!
But I think we both
already know who's
going to win.
Witness the true
power of humanity's
star!
... then...
Are YOU the star?
Can you really
protect humanity!?
H.. ha...
So I was wrong.
Darling...
You really are
strong enough to
get past ASGORE.
Well then...
It's time for
you to go.
Don't worry about
me.
I might seem like
I'm dying now,
but...
Dr. Alphys can
always repair me.
And... besides...
Even if I'm not
cut out to be
a star...
I still got to
perform for a
human, didn't I?
So, thank you,
darling...
You've been a
great audience!
OOH, LOOK AT
THESE RATINGS!!!
THIS IS THE MOST
VIEWERS I'VE EVER
HAD!!!
WE'VE REACHED THE
VIEWER CALL-IN
MILESTONE!
ONE LUCKY VIEWER
WILL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO TALK TO ME...
... BEFORE I LEAVE
THE UNDERGROUND
FOREVER!!
LET'S SEE WHO
CALLS IN FIRST!
HI, YOU'RE ON TV!
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY ON THIS,
OUR LAST SHOW???
NO, WAIT!
WAIT, BL...
H...
THEY ALREADY HUNG
UP.
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER
CALLER!!!
AH... I...
I SEE...
EVERYONE...
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DARLING.
PERHAPS... IT MIGHT BE
BETTER IF I STAY
HERE FOR A WHILE.
HUMANS ALREADY HAVE
STARS AND IDOLS,
BUT MONSTERS...
THEY ONLY HAVE ME.
IF I LEFT...
THE UNDERGROUND WOULD
LOSE ITS SPARK.
I'D LEAVE AN ACHING
VOID THAT CAN NEVER
BE FILLED.
SO... I THINK I'LL
HAVE TO DELAY MY
BIG DEBUT.
BESIDES.
YOU'VE PROVEN TO
BE VERY STRONG.
PERHAPS... EVEN STRONG
ENOUGH TO GET PAST
ASGORE.
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO PROTECT
HUMANITY.
HA, HA...
IT'S ALL FOR THE
BEST, ANYWAY.
THE TRUTH IS, THIS
FORM'S ENERGY
CONSUMPTION IS...
INEFFICIENT.
IN A FEW MOMENTS,
I'LL RUN OUT OF
BATTERY POWER, AND...
WELL.
I'LL BE ALRIGHT.
KNOCK 'EM DEAD,
DARLING.
AND EVERYONE...
THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN A
GREAT AUDIENCE!
Ohhhh my.
If you flipped my
switch, that can
only mean one
thing.
You're desperate
for the premiere
of my new body.
How rude...
Lucky for you,
I've been aching
to show this off
for a long time.
So... as thanks,
I'll give you a
handsome reward.
I'll make your
last living
moments...
ABSOLUTELY beautiful!
Speechless...?
Who can blame you?
Well... that's concise.
Beautiful. Sometimes
the fewest words
speak the loudest.
Nice. You get a
gold star.
Oh my... what a
great answer.
Oooooh, you said so
much about me...
I love how
passionate you are.
... even though I
don't understand
what you said...
Beautiful.
Why don't you
write a book?
Nice detail...
You're right, I do
look quite nice.
Wonderful! Amazing! A+...
I AM completely stunning.
Oh, I'm blushing...
You're completely right,
I am beautiful in
every way.
Oh my... I'm speechless...
You've completely
captured how
beautiful I am.
That's right.
Legs was the
correct answer!
How creative. Arms...
most people just
think about my legs.
My hair... yes,
I use metal hair
gel.
Yes, my personality
is quite charming,
isn't it?
They say I have
the voice of a
Siren...
... awooga!
Dancing...?
Thank you, I'm
self-taught.
Huh? This essay is
supposed to be about
me, not about you...
What a touching
confession! I'll add
it to the pile.
Toby? What the hell
is that?
Sounds... sexy.
Oh my! This is a family
friendly TV show.
Now stand still while
I murder you.
There you are,
  Frisk-darling.
Feast your eyes!
Dr. Alphys completed
  my wonderful new body.
Oooh!
And did you hear?
The barrier's OPEN!
I can't wait to see
  the sun...
... the greatest
  spotlight of all!!
Oh yes.
I suppose I should thank
  you, too, darling.
Before fighting you,
  I had...
Forgotten how fun it
  was to perform with
  others.
So I've been searching
  for HOT TALENTS to fill
  up my upcoming troupe.
So far, Shyren's agreed
  to be my back-up singer.
And Bl...
Napstablook, here, will
  be my sound mixer!
The three of us
  performing together...
It really feels overdue,
  doesn't it?
Frisk, darling.
Can you help me with
  something?
What kind of merchandise
  do you think humans
  would want to buy...?
I've thought of a few
  ideas so far.
Buttons (with my face)
Stickers (with my face)
CDs (with my face)
Posters (with my face)
T-shirts (with my face)
Underwear (with my face)
... and plush dolls of
  TORIEL.
But, you know.
With my face instead
  of hers.
So what do you think?
   
Fabulous!
I completely agree!
Oh, Frisk.
Why don't you go see
  how Alphys is doing?
Since the flash of light
  she's been working hard
  to set everything right.
Ha-Ha.
About time, huh?
OH MY GOD!
WILL YOU TWO
JUST SMOOCH 
ALREADY!?
THE AUDIENCE IS
DYING FOR SOME
ROMANTIC ACTION!!!
Mettaton NEO
G...
GUESS SHE SHOULD
HAVE WORKED MORE
ON THE DEFENSES...
...
YOU MAY HAVE
DEFEATED ME...
BUT...
I KNOW.
I CAN TELL FROM
THAT STRIKE, DARLING.
YOU WERE HOLDING
BACK.
YES, ASGORE WILL
FALL EASILY TO
YOU...
BUT YOU WON'T
HARM HUMANITY,
WILL YOU?
YOU AREN'T
ABSOLUTELY EVIL.
IF YOU WERE
TRYING TO BE,
THEN YOU MESSED UP.
AND SO LATE INTO
THE SHOW, TOO.
HA... HA.
AT LEAST NOW,
I CAN REST EASY.
KNOWING ALPHYS AND
THE HUMANS WILL
LIVE ON...!
GH...
GUESS YOU DON'T
WANNA JOIN MY
FAN CLUB...?

Yo, I know I'm not supposed
  to be here, but...
I wanna ask you something.
Man, I've never had to ask
  anyone this before...
Umm...
Yo... You're human, right?
Haha.
Man! I knew it!
... well, I know it now,
  I mean...
Undyne told me, um, "stay
  away from that human."
So, like, ummm...
I guess that makes us enemies
  or something.
But I kinda stink at that,
  haha.
Yo, say something mean so
  I can hate you?
Huh...?
Yo, that's your idea of
  something mean?
My sister says that to me
  ALL THE TIME!
Guess I have to do it, haha.
Yo, I... I hate your guts.
Man, I... I'm such a turd.
I'm... I'm gonna go home
  now.
Yo, what?
So I have to do it?
Here goes nothing...
Undyne...
You're...
You're hurt...
Yo... did you see that!?
Undyne just...
... TOUCHED ME!
I'm never washing my face
  ever again...!
Man, are you unlucky.
If you were standing just
  a LITTLE bit to the left...!
Yo, don't worry!
I'm sure we'll see her
  again!
... yo, did you notice?
She seemed really mad
  about something!
She looked liked she was
  gonna blast me to pieces!
But... sigh...
Then she decided to put
  me down...
Yo!
There's always next time,
  right? Let's go!
You aren't gonna tell my
  parents about this, are you?
Undyne!!!
I'll help you fight!!!
YO!!!!
You did it!!!
Undyne is RIGHT in front
  of you!!!
You've got front row seats
  to her fight!!!
... wait.
Who's she fighting???
H-hey!
So, one time.
We had a school project where
  we had to take care of
  a flower.
The king - we had to call him
  "Mr. Dreemurr" - volunteered
  to donate his own flowers.
He ended up coming to school
  and teaching the class about
  responsibility and stuff.
That got me thinking...
YO!
How COOL would it be if
  UNDYNE came to school!?
She could beat up ALL
  the teachers!!
Yo...
Yo...
Where's the umbrella...?
Ha... ha...
Yo!
Ready yet?
Yo!
You got us an umbrella?
You're the best!
Yo, you got an umbrella?
Awesome!
Yo! You can't hold an
  umbrella either?
If you're walking anyway,
  I guess I'll go with you,
  haha...
Let's go!
Yo, I already looked,
  Undyne's not over here.
So I guess I'll see
  ya later, haha.
See ya later!
Man, Undyne is sooooooo
  cool.
She beats up bad guys and
  NEVER loses.
If I was a human, I would
  wet the bed every night...
... knowing she was gonna
  beat me up!
Ha ha.
Ummm, maybe she wouldn't beat
  up the teachers...
She's too cool to ever
  hurt an innocent person!
Yo, you wanna see
  Undyne, right...?
Climb on my shoulders.
Put up your umbrella and
  climb on my shoulders.
Yo, you go on ahead.
Don't worry about me.
I always find a way to
  get through!
Owww...
Yo, try being a little
  less rough, haha.
Anyway, I'll look for
  another way through.
Later!
Yo!
Yo.
Undyne told me to stay
  away from you.
She said you...
You hurt a lot of people.
But, yo, that's not true,
  right!?
... yo...
Why won't you answer me?
A... a... and what's with
  that weird expression...?
Yo, dude...
I... I heard some things,
  and...
What?
Look over here?
What for  
Yo, w-w-wait!
Help!
I tripped!
Wh-what are you standing
  around for?
Get over here, dude!
I...
I'm slipping!
Undyne... you saved me...?
Yo, I thought I was a
  goner, haha...
... wait, are you okay?
It looks like you fell
  pretty hard...
Th-this is my fault.
I should have stayed away from
  them, like you said.
They just stood there...
Watching...
Waiting for me to fall.
They just went straight to
  fight you instead of
  helping me...
I was so scared, and you...
What?
You're gonna go fight them
  now?
But you look hurt...
You should rest, haha...
W-warriors don't rest, huh?
Undyne... you're really cool.
Y... y... yo... dude...
If... If y-you wanna hurt
  my friend...
You're gonna have to get
  through me, first.
She's gone...
Yo, you really saved my skin.
Guess being enemies was just
  a nice thought, haha.
We'll just have to be friends
  instead.
... man, I should REALLY go
  home...
I bet my parents are worried
  sick about me!
Later, dude!
Oh...
Oh man...
(Man, my h-heart's pounding
  right out of my chest...)
(... what would Undyne do?)
Yo...
Y-you'd b-better st-stop
  r-right where you are...
Cause if you w-wanna hurt
  anyone else... you're...
You're gonna have to get
  through me, first.
A... and... and...
S-see?
I knew y-you weren't so
  bad!
I've gotta go tell Undyne
  she was wrong about you!
Undyne...
You....
You saved me!
Huh?
They ran away?
Yo, you're wrong...
They went to get help!
They'll be back any second!!
O-okay, I'll go home...
Yo... did you see the
  way she was staring at
  you...?
That...
... was AWESOME!
I'm SOOOO jealous!
What'd you do to get her
  attention...?
Ha ha.
C'mon!
Let's go watch her beat
  up some bad guys!
She was just standing there
  waiting FOREVER, and
  then you just...!!!
Yo!
You're a kid too, right?
I can tell 'cause you're
  wearing a striped shirt.
I wonder if that weird skeleton
  is an adult or a kid.
Yo...
There you are!
I've been kinda worried
  about you since you
  ran away.
... but now I'm just kinda
  mad, ha ha.
If Undyne hadn't saved me,
  that woulda been bad...
Yo...
Uh...
Don't talk to me.
Yo!!!
What's up!?
I've been kinda, doing
  some thinking...
Maybe Undyne...
Isn't actually as cool as
  we thought.
She's just kinda... mean.
But YO!!!
I just found out about
  someone WAYYY cooler!!!
Nyeh heh heh!!!
Nyeh heh heh, dude.
Yo, everyone ran away and
  hid somewhere.
Man, adults can be so
  dumb sometimes, haha...
Don't they know we've
  got Undyne to protect us!?
Yo!
Are you sneaking out to
  see her, too?
Awesome...
She's the coolest, right!?
I wanna be just like her
  when I grow up...
Hey, don't tell my parents
  I'm here.
Ha ha.
OK, I'm ready when you
  are.
Yo!
Where were you going...?
My parents didn't tell you
  to come here, did they?
You know where you're
  going, right...?
I was just gonna follow
  you...
Ha ha.
Yo, this ledge is way
  too steep...
Hmmm....
Yo, you aren't going to
  be able to climb with
  an umbrella.
C'mon,
you got
this!
Monster Kid and Frisk
Please? 
 
         Yes         No 
Muffet
What is it,
deary?
No, no, it's
time to go~
...
well... maybe
ONE little
nibble~~
Just kidding,
of course~
If you don't mind
being gobbled up~
Ahuhuhu~
Ahuhuhuhu~
Well, I don't
mind keeping
you here~
Feeling comfortable
trapped in that
web?
It's time to go~
Ahuhuhu~
What are you
doing~
Why so pale?
You should be proud~
Proud that you're
going to make a
delicious cake~
Ahuhuhu~
Let you go?
Don't be silly~
Your SOUL is going
to make every spider
very happy~~~
You're scaring off
all my customers!
Oh, how rude of me!
I almost forgot
to introduce you
to my pet~
It's breakfast time,
isn't it?
Have fun, you two~ 
The person who warned
us about you...
Offered us a LOT of
money for your SOUL.
Looked like a total
nerd.
They had such a sweet
smile~ and... ahuhu~
She was very
adamant I run away
with her~~~
Ahuhuhu~~~
It's strange, but
I swore I saw them
in the shadows...
Changing shape...?
She even left a
route for me to
escape from~
Oh, it's lunch time,
isn't it?
And I forgot to
feed my pet~
With that money,
the spider clans
can finally be
reunited~
She said she would
block off the rest
of Hotland after I
followed her~
You haven't heard?
Spiders have been
trapped in the RUINS
for generations!
Foolish nerd~
A spider NEVER leaves
her web~
(Except to sell
pastries~)
Even if they go
under the door,
Snowdin's fatal cold
is impassable alone.
Ah, but I do feel
a little regret
over it now...
But with the money
from your SOUL, we'll
be able to rent
them a heated limo~
Yes, I should have
wrapped her up when
I had the chance~
And with all of
the leftovers...?
We could have a
nice vacation~
Or even build a
spider baseball
field~
She looked like she
would have made a
juicy donut~~~
But enough of that...
It's time for
dinner, isn't it?
Ahuhuhu~
Don't look so
blue, my deary~
... I think purple is
a better look on
you! Ahuhuhu~
You're still alive?
Ahuhuhu~
Oh, my pet~
Looks like it's
time for dessert~
Huh?
Where did you get
that...?
Did you steal it?
Oh, my pet~
It's time to show
them what we do
with thieves~
Huh?
A telegram from
the spiders in
the RUINS?
What?
They're saying
that they saw
you, and...
... that this is
an error message!?
... even if you
are stingy, you
never hurt a
single spider!
... even if you
hurt others, you
never hurt a
single spider!
... you helped donate
to their cause!
... you were
really passionate
about spiders!
... you're a total
spider fanatic!
They say even if
you are a hyper-
violent murderer...
You never laid a
single finger on a
spider!
Oh my, this has
all been a big
misunderstanding~
I thought you
were someone that
hated spiders~
The person who
asked for that SOUL...
They must have
meant a DIFFERENT
human in a
striped shirt~
The person who
warned me about
you...
They really had
no idea what they
were talking about~
Sorry for all the
trouble~
Ahuhuhu~
I'll make it up
to you~
You can come back
here any time...
And, for no charge
at all...
I'll wrap you
up and let you
play with my pet
again!
Ahuhuhuhuhuhu~
Just kidding~
I'll SPARE you
now~
Ahuhuhuhu...
Did you hear what they
  just said?
Did you hear what she
  said?
They said a human wearing a
  striped shirt will come
  through.
I heard that they hate
  spiders.
I heard that they love to
  stomp on them.
I heard that they hate
  everybody.
I heard that they like to
  tear their legs off.
I heard...
However...
And even if they gave us
  money, I heard...
... that they're awfully
  stingy with their money.
... a certain stingy human
  hates spiders.
You think your taste
  is too refined for our
  pastries, don't you, deary?
Ahuhuhu...
I disagree with that
  notion.
I think your taste...
Is exactly what this
  next batch needs!
... that can't be true,
  can it?
Ahuhuhu...
You donated so much money
  to us.
All the spiders want you
  to know how thankful
  they are!
We're in your debt, dearie~
... that they have some awful
  taste.
What a shame.
A human comes through and they
  aren't even fit to be eaten~
Oh well!
Rotten ingredients can
  always be discarded~
That was fun!
See you again, dearie!
Welcome to our parlor, dearie~
Interested in some spider
  pastries?
All proceeds go to real
  spiders~
Check out the webs to
  make a purchase~
There you are, dearie.
You are always welcome in
  my parlor!
Just stay on your best
  behavior~
Ueee hee hee hee~
Bonjour, dearie~
I just finished tallying up
  all of our donations!
We've finally raised enough
  to rescue all the spiders
  inside of the RUINS.
And we'll also be able to
  afford...!
... nothing, because we
  only sold one donut.
What's wrong with everyone?
Don't they like spiders~
4 pairs of stylish sunglasses
  for every spider!
4 pairs of waterproof booties
  for every spider!
4 pairs of stylish heels for
  every spider!
A spider baseball field!
We've already got the baseball
  donuts ready~
A spider football stadium!
We'll play with 4 balls on the
  field at once!
A brand new bakery!
Thank you so much, dearie!
It's all because of you 
(r money).
A vacation anywhere in the
  entire world!
Should we go to the tropics?
Or a creepy abandoned house?
We can't decide~
You've
GOT to
win!
Nacarat Jester
Hey, I haven't seen you
  around before.
It's nice to meet new
  people, isn't it?
I...
I don't know you.
We all know the underground
  has problems, but we
  smile anyway.
Why?
We can't do anything, so
  why be morose about it?
Smile smile.
Maybe I'll try frowning
  for once.
... no.
I just can't do it.
Oh?
We're free?
Finally...
I'll be able to stop
  smiling.
Just now, I felt my smile
  falter for a moment.
What's wrong?

i'm gonna keep working
  on that mix cd.
i've almost got a mix cd
  finished for my scary
  neighbor...
it's 74 minutes of people
  screaming their signature
  wrestling moves
but they're all autotuned.
i hope she likes it
oh..............
oh... a classic spooktune...
they don't make songs like
  this anymore...
dang... that ambience...
it's like my whole body
  is being spooked...

......................
  ...... something cool.
human....
i'll never forget when you
  cheered me on
when i was pretending to
  sleep...
no one had ever had so
  much faith in my fake
  sleep....
human...
i'll never forget...
that time you tried to
  destroy me...
but... you failed....
sorry...
i messed it up
uh.........
also......
this is awkward... but
what's....
  your name
everyone seems to know
  it now, except me.....
seems like i've been
  missing out lately
i was just sitting at home
  listening to tunes
there was a flash of light
  outside my window
i saw the snails on the farm
  disappear
then i heard a knock at
  the door
the flash of light wanted
  to come in...
i closed the blinds...
now everyone knows your
  name except for me
"frisk..."
ok, i wont forget it
your name...?
"frisk"...
i didnt forget
because i cried the
  letters into my hand
oh no...
the letters in my hand
  are joining together
oh no...
i'm going to forget your
  name...
oh no...
i'm trying to cry more
  tears into my hand...
oh no...
the tears are all forming
  a big pile...
oh no...
your name's getting really
  long
oh... hey... you...
followed me...
into my house...
...
m-make yourself at home???
oh...
you really came...
sorry, i...
wasn't expecting that.
it's not much, but make
  yourself at home.
oh... are you hungry...
i can get you something
  to eat...
here we go...
you'll lie down as long
  as you don't move.
so... only move around when
  you want to get up, i
  guess.
well, that was nice...
thank you...
awkward...
i'm working right now...
i mean...
welcome to blook family
  snail farm...
... yeah.
i'm the only employee.
this place used to get a lot
  of business...
but our main customer
  disappeared one day...
now it's just some hairy
  guy that shows up once
  a month...
really, i'm working...
i don't want the boss
  to get mad at me...
especially since i'm my
  own boss...
hmmm... i should probably
  try to make friends
  with my neighbor
she's kind of scary, but
  i feel like i'm always
  too late to make friends...
i should at least try...
oh.........
you both tried your best...
but the snail looks
  discouraged...
her best wasn't good
  enough...
oh..........
oh........
looks like you encouraged
  your snail too much...
all that pressure to
  succeed...
really got to her...
oh........
you won... congratulations.
as a prize, you get 9G.
sorry... we have to make
  a profit somehow...
your snail lost by a
  thin margin.
actually, the snail is
  under the false belief
  that it won...
oh no... the snail is looking
  over here...
here, i'll give you some
  money...
act like you won...
oh... that's my tv...
there's a show i like to
  watch on it...
sometimes...
Napstablook (call)
.....
oh........
hi...
mettaton...
i really liked
watching your show...
my life is pretty
boring... but...
seeing you on the
screen... brought
excitement to my
life... vicariously
i can't tell, but...
i guess this is
the last episode...?
i'll miss you...
mettaton......
... oh.... i didn't
mean to talk so
long...
oh..........
Napstablook and Frisk
do you want to try it...
 
         Yes         No
do you want...
... to join me...
         Yes         No
it's 10G to play.

Napstablook's Cousin (diary)
Dear Diary:
Shyren's sister "fell down"
  recently.
It's sad.
Without her sister to
  speak for her...
She's become more
  reclusive than ever.
So I reached out to her,
  and told her...
That she, Blooky, and I
  should all perform together
  sometime.
She seemed to like
  that idea.
Dearer Diary:
I like to buy a new diary
  for every entry I make.
I love to collect diaries.
Dearest Diary:
Our cousin left the farm
  to become a training dummy.
That leaves just Blooky
  and I.
Blooky asked me if I was
  going to try to become
  corporeal, too.
They sounded so...
Resigned...
Come on, Blooky.
You know I'd never leave
  you behind.
And besides...
I'd never find the kind
  of body I'm looking for,
  anyway.
My Darling Diary:
I met someone...
Interesting today.
Last week I posted that
  advertisement for my
  Human Fanclub.
Today was our first meeting.
Only one other person came.
Honestly, she's a dork.
And she's obsessed with
  these awful cartoons.
But she's kind of funny,
  too....
I want to see her again.
Diary... My dear:
My diary collection is
  going fabulously.
I have like five now.
Dear Diary:
She surpised me with
  something today.
Sketches of a body that
  she wants to create for
  me...
A form beyond my wildest
  fantasies.
In a form like that, I
  could finally feel
  like... "myself."
After all, there's no
  way I can be a star
  the way I am now.
Sorry, Blooky.
My dreams can't wait
  for anyone...

You tell the Lost Soul you
  think that crosswords
  are tougher than jumble.
It seems to have some dim
  recollection of this
  fact...
It nods its head, like it
  knew this without question...!
The other Lost Soul remembers
  this conversation, too!
You tell the Lost Soul that
  you'll continue to
  support her.
Something about the way you
  said that is familiar to
  her.
Suddenly, she remembers...
It's all flooding back!
You call the Lost Soul on
  the phone...
She starts to sweat.
She doesn't know why, but
  this all seems very
  familiar...
You ask the Lost Soul what
  her favorite cartoon is.
She can barely hold back
  from giving you an enormous
  answer...
You ask the Lost Soul for
  help on a quiz question.

Something is stirring within
  her...
Something stirs within her...
It's all flooding back!
Suddenly, her memories are
  flooding back!
Seeing her remember you, the
  male Lost Soul tried hard
  to remember you, too!
You refuse to fight the Lost
  Soul.
Something about this
  is so familiar to her...
You hug the Lost Soul and
  tell her that you're going
  to see her again.
Something about this
  is so familar to her...

  prefer butterscotch instead

ASRIEL DREEMURR ∞ATK ∞DEF
The Absolute GOD of Hyperdeath!
You held on to your hopes...
You reduced how much DAMAGE
  you'll take this turn!
You kept holding on.
DAMAGE reduced!
You think about why you're
  here now...
You can feel the empty
  space in your inventory
  get smaller and smaller!
Your items fill up with
  dreams.
You feel something faintly
  resonating within ASRIEL.
You feel something
  resonating within ASRIEL.
You feel something strongly
  resonating within ASRIEL.
You feel your friends' SOULs
  resonating within ASRIEL!
The whole world is ending.
Strangely, as your friends
  remembered you...
Something else began resonating
  within the SOUL, stronger
  and stronger.
It seems that there's still
  one last person that needs
  to be saved.
But who...?
Suddenly, you realize.
You reach out and call
  their name.
Can't move your body.
Nothing happened.
You struggle...
Nothing happened.
You tried to reach your
  SAVE file.
Nothing happened.
You tried again to reach
  your SAVE file.
Nothing happened.
Seems SAVING the game really
  is impossible.
SAVING over ASRIEL's file
  seems like the only way to
  defeat him...
But, having never SAVED
  before, you lack the power
  to do it.
But...
Maybe, with what little
  power you have...
You can SAVE something else.
Can't move your body.
!?!?
You called out to your
  friends with all your
  heart.
From somewhere, you felt
  their support...
You reached out to ASRIEL's
  SOUL and called out to your
  friends.
They're in there somewhere,
  aren't they?
Within the depths of ASRIEL's
  SOUL, something's resonating..!

  your response.
But it refused.
(Wow!)
(You are superfast at being
  wrong.)
This switch doesn't even
  work...
Every time this old tree
  grows any leaves, they fall
  right off.
It's a neat-looking tree.
(It's natural for a tree to
  lose its leaves.)
Ah, the cactus.
Truly the most tsundere
  of plants.
It's not like this cactus
  was waiting for you to come
  back or anything...
The fire isn't burning hot...
Just pleasantly warm.
You could put your hand inside.
(Toriel's small chair.)
(Its name is Chairiel.)
(Who knows what the future
  holds for Chairiel.)
Did you miss it?

  the right.

  white dog sneezing in its
  sleep.)
(You hear a tired voice.)
(You noticed there was
  a blue switch behind the
  top pillar.)
You peek inside...
Scandalous!
It's TORIEL's sock drawer.
You can't stop looking
  at the socks.
(It felt strange to lie
  in the bed.)
(It feels entirely too
  small for you now.)
You send the line back out.
(Someone's been smoking
  dog treats.)
(It's a squeaky chew toy.)
(It's too small to sleep
  on.)
(Unfortunately, it's just
  dry food.)

  into the kibble.)

  word 'sans' written on it
  in red marker.)

And this...
Is a snow poff.
This, however, is a snow poff.
Surprisingly, it's a snow poff.
Snow poff...
Is it really a snow poff?
Behold!
A snow poff.
What's this called?

  spaghetti.)

  eating it and just...)
(Gave up.)
(It's an unplugged microwave.)
(All of the settings
  say "spaghetti.")
It's a note from Papyrus...
It's illegible chicken-
  scratch.
(This note is written
  very oddly, as if the paper was
  moving while it was written.)
(It says...)
(Out to lunch...?)
There's some narration on this
  cardboard box.
These instructions
  are written in
  chicken scratch.
It's some sort of checkpoint
  or sentry-station.
But there are bottles of
  ketchup, mustard, and relish
  sitting inside...
You must have something better to do than read this message.
(You're carrying too many
  items.)
(You got the Snowman Piece.)
(A useless pile of snow.)
Seems like the base of a
  snowdog.
It's a pile of mushy snow.
This dog is staring blankly
  into the snow, waiting for
  it to turn into art.
It's the broken head of
  a snowdog.
(It's a tough-looking branch.)
(It's too heavy to pick up.)
(It's been smashed like it
  was nothing...)
Just a conveniently-shaped
  lamp.

  up in the trash can.)

  of despair.)

(As per culinary standard,
  a death forcefield surrounds
  the kitchen.)

  a death forcefield surrounds
  the area of intrigue.)

  death forcefield you see

(It's a snail.)
(For some reason, you can't
  help but wonder what it
  tastes like...)
(You wonder if Toriel has
  seen it.)
(There's a piece of cheese
  inside this computerized
  laser-safe.)
(The lasers have melted the
  edges of the cheese...)

  the safe and took the
  cheese out.)

  bowl.)

  programmed a whole game.)

(It's hard-boiled.)
(You tried to pet the dog,
  but it collapsed into a
  pile of fluff...)
(Seems like it was actually
  just a dog-shaped husk of
  dog residue.)
(It's a pile of dog residue.)
But nobody came.
You took 758G from behind the
  counter.
Nothing left.
(There's a note here.)
But, like.
Nobody
  came and
  stuff.
Stole 5G
  from the
  till.
The till
  is empty.

  can.)

  nothing but an empty
  bag of chips.)

  enter...)
(You touch the couch.)
(It makes a jangling sound.)
(You find a bunch of loose
  coins inside the couch...)
(You got 20G.)
(It's a saggy old couch.)
(It's a racecar bed, neatly
  made.)
(Complex manuals and
  children's books.)
(The bookshelf is filled
  with complex tomes
  about puzzle creation.)
(And children's books.)
(The computer's internet
  browser is opened to
  a social media site.)
(The computer's internet
  browser is opened to
  a music-sharing forum.)
(Looks like this dog makes
  a lot of bad posts
  on-line.)
(Text to speech is on.)
(Seems like the dog barks,
  and it translates to these
  bad posts.)
(It doesn't really know what
  it's saying.)
(Seems like most bad posts
  on-line, are actually this
  dog.)
(Thinking about this...)
(Brings you relief.)
(Action figures of many
  sexy robots.)
(It's a box of bones.)
(It's unlocked.)

  can't even wash your
  hands...)

  A NEW PROGRAM - MTT.")

  tree.)
(Some of the presents are
  addressed from "Santa" to
  various locals.)
(Nothing for you.)
(Somewhere, you hear a whinny
  of dismay.)
(You tip the ketchup...)
(The cap falls off and all
  the ketchup in the bottle
  pours onto your food.)
(It's just the word "Bark"
  but in flowery cursive.)
(It's playing poker against
  itself.)
(It appears to be losing.)
(It has switched to Go Fish.)
(It finally won a game of
  poker against itself...?)
(Some unfinished book.)
(It's a potted plant.)

  you for your sins.)

(Presumably to be pushed.)
(You put the dog on the
  ground.)
(You threw the Bad Memory
  away.)
(But it came back.)
(Despite what seems like
  common sense, you threw
  away the letter.)
(The letter is too powerful to
  throw away.)
(It gets the better of you.)
(Seems like a comfy bed.)
(You could probably climb
  into it if you were to
  the left of it.)
(There's a VHS player with a
  few tapes picked out beside
  it...)
(They seem to be labelled
  in a specific order.)
(Will you watch one...?)
(Choose a tape to watch.)
(It's a fake plant.)
(It's some kind of operating
  table.)
(It's sticky...)
(There's a note on the
  ground...)
(You can't make it all out.)
(That's all you could read.)
(It's a refrigerator.)
(It's empty.)
(It's a refrigerator.)
(It seems to contain
  samples of some kind.)
There's something here...
It feels like it's
  breathing.
There's something here...
It feels like a tree, ripe
  with delicious fruit.
There's something here...
Something in the shape
  of a man.
There's something here...
It feels warm, and moist.

Nice Cream Guy
Hello!
Would you like some
  Nice Cream?
It's the frozen treat
  that warms your heart!
 
Nice Cream!
It's the frozen treat
  that warms your heart!
Here you go!
Have a super-duper day!
(You got the Nice Cream.)
Huh?
You don't have enough
  money...
I wish I could make
  Nice Cream for free...
It looks like you're
  holding too much stuff!
Oh well!
Well then...
Tell your friends...
There's ice cream...
Out in the middle of
  the woods...
Hey, you have an umbrella,
  just like my cart...
Such solidarity!
I have no choice but to
  give you a deal!
Umbrella solidarity!?
I guess I have to give
  you a deal...
Hey!
You have 3 Punch Cards!
How about redeeming them
  for some Nice Cream!?
Huh? No money?
Sorry, I can't give it to
  you for free.
Huh? You can't afford it
  even with the discount?
I...
There's ice cream...
Hidden in the depths of a
  watery cavern...
Hello...
Would you like some
  Nice Cream...?
It's the frozen treat...
That warms your heart.
Nice Cream.
It's the frozen treat.
That warms your heart.
Here.
(You got the Nice Cream.)
You don't have enough
  money...
Drop something.
Life... is suffering.
I don't understand why
  these aren't selling...
It's the perfect weather
  for something cold...
I relocated my store, but
  there are still no
  customers...
I thought for sure if I
  went to Hotland, I'd sell
  some Nice Creams.
But nobody wants them.
Everyone's just eating
  Starfaits and Glamburgers.
So!!!
I'm so happy!!
Nice Cream is really
  changing the world!!
Hey!
It's you again!
Business is excellent here!
These two fellas bought
  ALL my ice cream!
I've actually sold out of
  everything!!!
... sorry.
Wait!
I've still got something
  for you!
... a big smile!
How about that!
I'm so excited to sell
  Nice Cream on the surface!
If all humans are like you,
  then...!
... then I'll still be
  able to sell to monsters,
  I hope.
If all humans are like you,
  I think it'll be a modest
  success!
If all humans are like you,
  I think it'll be really
  popular!
OH!!!!
A CUSTOMER!!!
Fortunately, I've thought
  of a solution!!
Punch cards!!
Every time you buy a
  Nice Cream, you can take a
  punch card from the box.
If you have 3 cards, you
  can trade them for a
  free Nice Cream!
They're sure to get the
  customers to come back!
Anyway...
I'm having a going out of
  business sale.
Nice Cream Guy (Nice Cream wrapper)
You're just great!
You look nice today!
Are those claws natural?
You're super spiffy!
Have a wonderful day!
Is this as sweet as you?
Love yourself! I love you!
Nice Cream Guy and Frisk
Now just 15G!
 
         Yes         No 
Now just 25G!
 
         Yes         No 
Discount Ice Cream! 15G!
 
         Yes         No 
It's free!
 
         Yes         No 
Now only 12G!
 
         Yes         No 
Now just 12G.
 
         Yes         No 
Nice Cream Guy and Narrator
Super! Here you go!

Omega Flowey
Hee hee hee.
Did you really think
  you could run away?
Did you really think
  I was gonna be
  satisfied...
... killing you only
  ONE time?
Pathetic...
Now you're REALLY
  gonna die!
Do you even realize
  what will happen if
  you defeat me...?
Don't you get it?
There's no such thing
  as happy endings.
This is all that's
  left...!
Are you REALLY that
  desperate...?
Hee hee hee...
Are you letting me
  kill you...
... on PURPOSE?
SICKO. Ha ha ha.
Honestly, fighting
  you IS pretty fun...
... So even if you
  ARE a sicko, I'll
  take it!
Maybe you're wondering
  if I ever get tired
  of winning...
Wanna see my answer?
Howdy!
It's me, FLOWEY.
FLOWEY the FLOWER!
I owe you a HUGE thanks.
You really did a number
on that old fool.
Without you, I NEVER could
have gotten past him.
But now, with YOUR help...
 
He's DEAD.
And I'VE got the human
SOULS!
Boy!
I've been empty for so
long...
It feels great to have a
SOUL inside me again.
Mmmm, I can feel them
wriggling...
Awww, you're feeling
left out, aren't you?
Well, that's just perfect.
After all, I only have
six souls.
I still need one more...
Before I become GOD.
And then, with my
newfound powers...
Monsters.
Humans.
Everyone.
I'll show them all the REAL
meaning of this world.
Oh, and forget about escaping
to your old SAVE FILE.
It's gone FOREVER.
Golly, if only you
had a SAVE FILE you
could run away to...
But you were just
too STUPID to make one!
But don't worry.
Your old friend FLOWEY...
Has worked out a replacement
for you!
I'll SAVE over your own
death.
So you can watch me tear
you to bloody pieces...
Over, and over, and over...
... what?
Do you really think
you can stop ME?
Hee hee hee...
You really ARE an idiot.
Long ago, two races
ruled over Earth:
HUMANS and MONSTERS.   
One day, they all
disappeared without
a trace.
No... NO!!!
This CAN'T be
  happening!!!
You... YOU...
You IDIOT. 
Did you REALLY
  think...
You could
  defeat ME!?
I am the GOD of
  this world.
And YOU?
You're HOPELESS.
Hopeless and
  alone...
Golly, that's
  right!
Your WORTHLESS
  friends...
... can't save
  you now.
Call for help.
I dare you.
Cry into the
  darkness!
"Mommy! Daddy!"
"Somebody help!"
See what good
  it does you!
You... uh...
Would you STOP that?
Anyway, YOU!
But nobody came.
Boy!
What a shame!
Nobody else...
Is gonna get to
  see you DIE!!!
What? 
How'd you...? 
Well, I'll just
Wh... 
Where are my
  powers!? 
The souls...? 
What are they
  doing? 
NO!! NO!!!!! 
YOU CAN'T DO
  THAT!!! 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
  TO OBEY ME!! 
STOP!!!
  STOP IT!!!!! 
STOOOOPPPP!!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
  And you're NEVER
  waking up! 
  This is all just
  a bad dream... 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Originally, we dug mazes
  with puzzles in order to
  foil human attacks.
But now, building things
  winding and confusing....
It's some awful tradition.
You can't go (ugh) two feet
  without being up to your
  armpits in puzzles.
The surface world...
Really!
Maybe I'll be able to
  go two feet without running
  into a puzzle.
One thing I can say...
I respect Mettaton for not
  putting any puzzles here.
At another hotel, I had
  to find 12 magic keys just to
  unlock the shower.
Onionsan
Did y'hear!?
You're back!
I'll tell you a big secret.
I'm starting a band, y'hear?
It's called the Red Hot
  Chibi Peppers.
All I've thought of is
  the name.
And I don't, play...
Instruments, or sing.
Well!
Do you think we'll be
  popular!!!
Yeah, me too...
Hey... there...
Noticed you were...
Here...
I'm Onionsan!
Onionsan, y'hear!
You're visiting Waterfall, huh!It's great here, huh!
You love it, huh!
Yeah!
Me too!
It's my Big Favorite.
Even though, the water's
  getting so shallow here...
I, have to sit down all
  the time, but...
He-hey! That's OK!
It beats moving to the city!
And living in a crowded
  aquarium!
Like all my friends did!
And the aquarium's full,
  a-anyway, so, even if I
  wanted to, I...
That's okay though, y'hear!
Undyne's gonna fix
  everything, y'hear!
I'm gonna get out of here
  and live in the ocean!
Y'hear!
Hey... there...
That's the end of this room.
I'll see you around!
Have a good time!
In Waterfalllllllllllllllll
  lllllllllllll
Oh!
Did y'hear!!!
...
I got nothing else...
To talk about...
I've been wondering when
  we're all gonna go free.
S-since... if we did...
How would I ever know?
Well, I'll keep my
  tentacles out for you!
Y'hear!
As soon as I know I'll be
  the first to tell you!
Y'hear!!
It's gotta be any day now!

MONSTER!!
ORANGE TILES
ARE ORANGE-
SCENTED.
THEY WILL MAKE
YOU SMELL
DELICIOUS!
BLUE TILES ARE
WATER TILES.
SWIM THROUGH
IF YOU LIKE,
BUT...
IF YOU SMELL
LIKE ORANGES!
THE PIRANHAS
WILL BITE
YOU.
ALSO, IF A
BLUE TILE IS
NEXT TO A,
YELLOW TILE,
THE WATER WILL
ALSO ZAP YOU!
PURPLE TILES
ARE SLIPPERY!
YOU WILL SLIDE
TO THE NEXT
TILE!
HOWEVER, THE
SLIPPERY
SOAP...
SMELLS LIKE
LEMONS!!
WHICH PIRANHAS
DO NOT LIKE!
PURPLE AND
BLUE ARE OK!
FINALLY,
PINK TILES.
THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING.
STEP ON THEM
ALL YOU LIKE.
HOW WAS THAT!?
UNDERSTAND???
GREAT!!
THEN THERE'S ONE
LAST THING...
THIS PUZZLE...
IS ENTIRELY RANDOM
!!!!!!
WHEN I PULL THIS
SWITCH, IT WILL
MAKE A PUZZLE...
THAT HAS NEVER
BEEN SEEN BEFORE!
NOT EVEN I WILL
KNOW THE SOLUTION!
NYEH HEH HEH!
GET READY...!
OKAY...
I GUESS I'LL
REPEAT MYSELF...
RED TILES ARE
IMPASSABLE.
YELLOW TILES ARE
ELECTRIC AND
DANGEROUS.
BLUE TILES MAKE
YOU FIGHT A
MONSTER.
GREEN TILES ARE
WATER TILES.
ORANGE TILES ARE
ORANGE SCENTED.
IF YOU STEP ON
ORANGE, DON'T STEP
ON GREEN.
BROWN TILES ARE...
WAIT!!!
THERE ARE NO
BROWN TILES...
PURPLE TILES
SMELL LIKE
LEMONS...
WHY DON'T THE
YELLOW ONES
SMELL LEMONY?
UMM...
WAIT!!
DID I MIX UP
GREEN AND BLUE!?
THE BLUE ONES
ARE WATER ONES!
PINK TILES...
I DON'T...
REMEMBER???
WAIT!!!
THOSE ONES DON'T
DO ANYTHING.
OKAY!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
BETTER NOW!?
..........
OK, YOU KNOW
WHAT???
HOW ABOUT...
YOU JUST...
DO THIS PUZZLE...
ON YOUR OWN...
I'LL LEAVE THE
INSTRUCTIONS...
JUST READ THEM.
THEN WHEN YOU
UNDERSTAND IT...
YOU CAN THROW
THE SWITCH.
AND DO IT AT
YOUR OWN PACE.
GOOD LUCK.
NYEH...
HEH...
HEH!
NYOO HOO HOO...
I CAN'T EVEN
STOP SOMEONE AS
WEAK AS YOU...
UNDYNE'S GOING TO
BE DISAPPOINTED
IN ME.
I'LL NEVER JOIN THE
ROYAL GUARD...
AND...
MY FRIEND QUANTITY
WILL REMAIN
STAGNANT!
WOWIE!!
YOU DID IT!!!
YOU DIDN'T DO A
VIOLENCE!!!
TO BE HONEST,
I WAS A LITTLE
AFRAID...
BUT YOU'RE ALREADY
BECOMING A GREAT
PERSON!
I'M SO PROUD I
COULD CRY!!!
... WAIT, WASN'T I
SUPPOSED TO
CAPTURE YOU...?
WELL, FORGET IT!
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE THE BEST
PERSON YOU CAN BE.
SO LET'S LET
BYBONES BE
BYBONES.
I'LL EVEN TELL YOU
HOW TO LEAVE THE
UNDERGROUND!
JUST KEEP GOING
EAST!
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL
REACH THE KING'S
CASTLE.
THEN YOU CAN
LEAVE!
REALLY!?
YOU WANT TO BE
FRIENDS, WITH ME???
WELL THEN...
I GUESS...
I GUESS
I CAN MAKE AN
ALLOWANCE FOR YOU!
HUH?
WHY WOULD YOU...
BERATE YOURSELF
SO LOUDLY???
IS IT BECAUSE...
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE MY FRIEND?
NO!!!
YOU'RE GREAT!!!
I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND!
WOWIE!!
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
OUR FIRST DATE...
AND I'VE ALREADY
MANAGED TO HIT
THE FRIEND ZONE!!!
WHO KNEW THAT
ALL I NEEDED TO
MAKE PALS...
WOW!!!
I HAVE FRIENDS!!!
AND WHO KNEW THAT
ALL I NEEDED TO
MAKE THEM...
WAS TO GIVE PEOPLE
AWFUL PUZZLES AND
THEN FIGHT THEM??
YOU TAUGHT ME A
LOT, HUMAN.
I HEREBY GRANT
YOU PERMISSION
TO PASS THROUGH!
AND I'LL GIVE
YOU DIRECTIONS
TO THE SURFACE.
CONTINUE FORWARD
UNTIL YOU REACH THE
END OF THE CAVERN.
THEN... WHEN YOU
REACH THE CAPITAL,
CROSS THE BARRIER.
THAT'S THE MAGICAL
SEAL TRAPPING US
ALL UNDERGROUND.
ANYTHING CAN ENTER
THROUGH IT, BUT
NOTHING CAN EXIT...
... EXCEPT SOMEONE
WITH A POWERFUL
SOUL.
... LIKE YOU!!!
THAT'S WHY THE
KING WANTS TO
ACQUIRE A HUMAN.
HE WANTS TO OPEN
THE BARRIER WITH
SOUL POWER.
THEN US MONSTERS
CAN RETURN TO
THE SURFACE!
YOU'RE BACK AGAIN?!?!
I FINALLY REALIZE
THE TRUE REASON WHY.
YOU...
JUST MISS SEEING MY
FACE SO MUCH...
I'M NOT SURE I
CAN FIGHT SOMEONE
WHO FEELS THIS WAY.
BUT MOSTLY... I'M GETTING
REALLY TIRED OF
CAPTURING YOU!
SO...
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
 
OKAY...
I GUESS.
IF YOU WANT ME TO
CAPTURE YOU.
I'LL TRY AGAIN!!!
... OKAY...
I GUESS I'LL ACCEPT
MY FAILURE...
BEPIS.
armor
MY BROTHER ALWAYS
GOES OUT TO EAT.
BUT...
RECENTLY, HE TRIED
'BAKING' SOMETHING.
IT WAS LIKE...
A QUICHE.
BUT FILLED WITH A
SUGARY, NON-EGG
SUBSTANCE.
HOW ABSURD!
THAT'S MY ROOM!
IF YOU'VE
FINISHED LOOKING
AROUND...
WE COULD GO IN
AND...
HANG-OUT LIKE
A PAIR OF VERY
COOL FRIENDS?
DO WHATEVER
PEOPLE DO WHEN
THEY DATE???
THERE ARE NO
SKELETONS INSIDE
MY CLOSET!!!
EXCEPT ME
SOMETIMES.
IT'S OK TO BE
INTIMIDATED BY
MY FASHION SENSE.
SO, UM...
IF YOU'VE SEEN
EVERYTHING...
DO YOU WANT TO
START HANGING OUT?
DO YOU WANT TO
START THE DATE?
OKAY!!!

STEP THREE...
PUT ON NICE
CLOTHES TO
SHOW YOU CARE!

WAIT A SECOND.
WEAR CLOTHING...
THAT THING ON
YOUR BODY...
THAT BANDAGE
HANGING OFF
OF YOU...
THAT RIBBON IN
YOUR HAIR...
THAT BANDANNA
AROUND YOUR
HEAD...
THAT TUTU AROUND
YOUR WAIST...
THOSE GLASSES ON
YOUR FACE...
THAT APRON YOU
PUT ON...
THAT COWBOY HAT
ON YOUR HEAD...
THAT LOCKET
AROUND YOUR NECK.
YOU'RE WEARING
CLOTHING RIGHT
NOW!!!
NOT ONLY THAT...
EARLIER TODAY,
YOU WERE ALSO
WEARING CLOTHING!
  
NO...
COULD IT BE???
  
YOU'VE WANTED TO
DATE ME FROM
THE VERY
BEGINNING!??
YOU'VE WANTED TO
HANG OUT WITH
ME FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING!??
NO!!
YOU PLANNED IT
ALL!!!
YOU'RE WAY BETTER
AT DATING THAN
I AM!!!
N-NOOOO!!!
YOUR DATING POWER

YOU'RE WAY BETTER
AT HANGING OUT
THAN I AM!!!
N-NOOOO!!!
YOUR FRIENDSHIP

DESPITE THAT, YOU

CLOTHING TODAY, OF
ALL DAYS...?
WAS YOUR INTEREST
IN ME...
WAS YOUR
FRIENDSHIP...
PREDESTINED!?!?
NYEH!
DON'T THINK YOU'VE
BESTED ME YET!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS...
HAVE NEVER BEEN
BEATEN AT DATING,
AND I NEVER WILL!
JUST IN CASE
SOMEBODY HAPPENS
TO ASK ME ON
A DATE!!!
HAVE NEVER BEEN
BEATEN AT HANGING
OUT, AND I NEVER
WILL!
JUST IN CASE
SOMEONE WANTS
TO HANG OUT!
I CAN EASILY
KEEP UP WITH
YOU!!!
YOU SEE,
I, TOO, CAN WEAR
CLOTHING!!!
IN FACT...
I ALWAYS WEAR MY
"SPECIAL" CLOTHES
UNDERNEATH MY
REGULAR CLOTHES!!
BEHOLD!!!
NYEH!
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF MY
SECRET STYLE!?!
NO!!!
A GENUINE
COMPLIMENT...!!!
YOUR HONESTY...!
IT SHOWS HOW
MUCH YOU REALLY
CARE!!!
HOWEVER...
YOU DON'T TRULY
UNDERSTAND THE 
HIDDEN POWER OF
THIS OUTFIT!!!
THEREFORE...
WHAT YOU JUST
SAID IS INVALID!!!
THIS DATE WON'T
ESCALATE ANY
FURTHER!!!
THIS HANG-OUT
WON'T ESCALATE
ANY FURTHER!
... UNLESS
YOU FIND MY
SECRET!!
BUT THAT WON'T
HAPPEN!!
MY HAT...?
MY HAT.
MY HAT!
W-WELL THEN...
YOU FOUND MY
SECRET!
I SUPPOSE I HAVE
NO CHOICE!
IT'S A PRESENT...
A PRESENT J-JUST
FOR YOU!!!
GO AHEAD!
OPEN IT!
YOU CAN'T EVEN
BRING YOURSELF TO
HARM MY DELICATE
WRAPPING??
N-NO...
THAT TECHNIQUE!
IT'S TOO STRONG!
COUNTERATTACK!
I'LL OPEN THE
PRESENT MYSELF!!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS?
"SPAGHETTI."
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,
ISN'T IT?
RIGHT!
BUT OH-SO WRONG!
NYEH HEH HEH!
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA!
THOUGH THIS
APPEARS TO BE
SPAGHETTI...
THIS AIN'T ANY
PLAIN OL' PASTA!

ARTISAN'S WORK!
SILKEN SPAGHETTI,
FINELY AGED IN
AN OAKEN CASK...
THEN COOKED BY
ME, MASTER CHEF
PAPYRUS!
HUMAN!!!
IT'S TIME TO

ANY FURTHER!
EAT THIS!
MY ULTIMATE
TECHNIQUE!!!

EXPRESSION!!!
YOU MUST REALLY
LOVE MY COOKING!
AND BY EXTENSION,
ME!!!
MAYBE EVEN MORE
THAN I DO!!!
YOU MEAN...
YOU'RE LETTING ME
HAVE IT INSTEAD?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE
PASTA...
IMPOSSIBLE!!
TAKING MY PRESENT
AND TURNING IT
AROUND ON ME!
AUGH!!!
URRRGH!!!
NOOOOOOOO!!!
HUMAN.
IT'S CLEAR NOW.
YOU'RE MADLY IN
LOVE WITH ME.
EVERYTHING YOU DO.
EVERYTHING
YOU SAY.
IT'S ALL BEEN
FOR MY SAKE.
HUMAN. I WANT
YOU TO BE
HAPPY, TOO.
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO EXPRESS MY
FEELINGS.
IT'S TIME THAT
I TOLD YOU.
I, PAPYRUS...
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
OBSESSED WITH ME.
HUMAN. I WANT
YOU TO BE
HAPPY,TOO.
I, PAPYRUS...
I...
UM...
BOY, IS IT HOT
IN HERE, OR IS
IT JUST ME??
...
OH, SHOOT.
HUMAN, I...
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T LIKE YOU
THE WAY YOU
LIKE ME.
ROMANTICALLY,
I MEAN.
I MEAN, I TRIED
VERY HARD TO!
I THOUGHT THAT
BECAUSE YOU
FLIRTED WITH ME...
THAT I WAS
SUPPOSED
TO GO ON A
DATE WITH YOU.
THEN, ON THE DATE,
FEELINGS WOULD
BLOSSOM FORTH!!!
I WOULD BE ABLE
TO MATCH YOUR
PASSION FOR ME!
BUT ALAS...
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS...
HAVE FAILED.
I FEEL JUST THE
SAME AS BEFORE.
AND INSTEAD, BY
DATING YOU...
I HAVE ONLY DRAWN
YOU DEEPER...
INTO YOUR INTENSE
LOVE FOR ME!
A DARK PRISON OF
PASSION, WITH NO
ESCAPE.
HOW COULD I HAVE
DONE THIS TO MY
DEAR FRIEND...?
NO! WAIT!
THAT'S WRONG!
I CAN'T FAIL AT
ANYTHING!!!
HUMAN!!!
I'LL HELP YOU
THROUGH THESE
TRYING TIMES!!!
I'LL KEEP BEING
YOUR COOL
FRIEND...
AND ACT LIKE THIS
ALL NEVER
HAPPENED.
AFTER ALL, YOU
ARE VERY GREAT.
IT WOULD BE
TRAGIC TO LOSE
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.
SO PLEASE....
DON'T CRY BECAUSE
I WON'T KISS YOU.
BECAUSE, I DON'T
EVEN HAVE LIPS.
AND HEY, SOMEDAY,
YOU'LL FIND
SOMEONE AS
GREAT AS ME.
WELL, NO.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
BUT I'LL HELP YOU
SETTLE FOR
SECOND BEST!!!
NYEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH!!!
HMM...
WELL, I'M FLATTERED
YOU CARE SO MUCH.
BUT MAYBE COOL
IT A LITTLE BIT...?
YOU ARE A VERY
NICE PERSON.
I'M GLAD WE'RE
FRIENDS.
BUT, I THINK YOU
CAN REACH YOUR
MAX POTENTIAL,,,
IF YOU LIVE MORE
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
RATHER THAN JUST
FOR MINE.
HMMM...
HEY, I KNOW THE
SOLUTION!!!
YOU SHOULD HANG
OUT WITH MY BOSS,

I THINK IF YOU
SPREAD YOUR FRIEND-

HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.

 I'LL JUST USE
 A REALLY COOL
 REGULAR ATTACK.

 HAVE BROUGHT ONE
  OF THOSE.
 SO YOU'RE
 SERIOUS...

 OF ADMIRERS!!
 BUT...
 HOW WILL I
 KNOW IF PEOPLE
 SINCERELY LIKE
 ME???
 WILL ANYONE LIKE
 ME AS SINCERELY
 AS YOU?
 SOMEONE LIKE
 YOU IS REALLY
 RARE...
 I DON'T THINK
 THEY'LL LET YOU
 GO...
 AND DATING MIGHT
 BE KIND OF
 HARD...
 AFTER YOU'RE
 CAPTURED AND
 SENT AWAY.
 URGH...
 WHO CARES!
 GIVE UP!!
 GIVE UP OR
 FACE MY...
 SPECIAL ATTACK!!!
 YEAH!!!
 VERY SOON I WILL
 USE MY
 SPECIAL ATTACK! 
 NOT TOO LONG
 AND I WILL
 USE THAT
 SPECIAL ATTACK!!!
 THIS IS YOUR
 LAST CHANCE...
 BEFORE MY
 SPECIAL ATTACK!!
 BEHOLD...!
 MY SPECIAL
 ATTACK!
 *SIGHHERE'S AN
 ABSOLUTELY
 NORMAL ATTACK.
 NYEH HEH HEH!
 I DON'T DESERVE
 SUCH HOSPITALITY
 FROM YOU ...
 YOUR BARBS HIDE A
 HIDDEN AFFECTION!
 YOU EMOTIONAL
 CACTUS!
 DON'T WASTE YOUR
 WORDS ON ME!
 LET'S DATE

 YOU WANT ME TO
 FEEL BETTER
 ABOUT FIGHTING

 MEETING ALL MY
 STANDARDS!!!
 I GUESS THIS MEANS
 I HAVE TO GO ON A
 DATE WITH YOU...?
 OH NO!!!
 THAT HUMILITY...
 IT REMINDS ME OF,
 MYSELF!!!
 YOU'RE MEETING ALL
  MY STANDARDS!!!
I MUST
CAPTURE
A
HUMAN!
THEN
EVERY
ONE
WILL,
 NO! WAIT!!

 I COULD NEVER
  CAPTURE YOU!!
 THIS IS AN ERROR
 MESSAGE.
 REALLY!!!
 YOU'RE TOO WEAK!!
 I WAS EASILY ABLE
 TO CAPTURE YOU!!!
 I WILL NOW SEND
 YOU TO THE
 CAPTURE ZONE!!
 OR, AS SANS
 CALLS IT...
 OUR GARAGE???
 YOU'RE IN THE
 DOGHOUSE NOW!
 NYEH HEH HEH HEH

 WELL!!! YOU MAY
 HAVE CLEVERLY
 ESCAPED FROM
 JAIL BEFORE...
 BUT THIS TIME,
 I'VE UPGRADED
 THE FACILITIES.
 NOT ONLY WILL
 YOU BE
 TRAPPED...
 BUT YOU WON'T
 EVEN WANT
 TO LEAVE!!!
 YOU ARE...
 PERSISTENT!
 BUT!
 IT JUST WON'T
 WORK ON ME!
 I AM THE
 PERSISTENTEST!
 AND IF YOU
 THINK YOU ARE
 PERSISTENESTER...
 THAT IS WRONG!
 GRAMATICALLY
 WRONG!
 BECAUSE THE
 CORRECT FORM
 WOULD BE...
 NOT AS
 PERSISTENTEST AS
 PAPYRUS, THE
 PERSISTENTESTEST!"
 I HOPE YOU
 ENJOYED THIS
 LESSON.
 YOU'RE BLUE NOW.

FLOATING HEART.
BUT WHO DOESN'T!?
TRY AGAIN!
THIS SHIRT DIDN'T
ORIGINALLY SAY
'COOL,' BUT I
IMPROVED IT.
EXPERT TIP: ALL
CLOTHING ARTICLES
CAN BE IMPROVED
THIS WAY.
BUT THAT'S NOT A
SECRET!!!
IT'S JUST GOOD
ADVICE!!!
HOLDING MY HAND
SO I'LL TELL
YOU THE ANSWER...
NO!!!
I MUST RESIST!!
THERE'S NO SECRET
TO MY LEGS.
JUST HARD WORK
AND PERSEVERANCE...
HUMAN SOULS ARE
STRONGER THAN
MONSTER SOULS...
BUT THE SOLES OF
OUR SHOES ON THE
OTHER HAND...!
... ARE ABOUT THE
SAME.
HAT DIALOGUE.
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE
RUNNING AWAY.
YOU'RE OVERWHELMED
BY THE SIGHT OF
MY COOL VIBES.

THIS IS THE
INVISIBLE...
ELECTRICITY
MAZE!!!
WHEN YOU TOUCH
THE WALLS OF
THIS MAZE,
THIS ORB WILL
ADMINISTER A
HEARTY ZAP!
SOUND LIKE
FUN???
BECAUSE!
THE AMOUNT OF
FUN YOU WILL
PROBABLY HAVE,
IS ACTUALLY
RATHER SMALL
I THINK.
OK, YOU CAN
GO AHEAD NOW.
SANS!!!
WHAT DID YOU
DO?!?!
OH, OKAY.
HOLD THIS PLEASE!
OKAY, TRY NOW!
INCREDIBLE!!
YOU SLIPPERY
SNAIL!!
YOU SOLVED IT
SO EASILY...
TOO EASILY!
HOWEVER!!
THE NEXT
PUZZLE WILL
NOT BE EASY!
IT IS DESIGNED
BY MY BROTHER,

CONFOUNDED!
I KNOW I AM!
NYEH HEH HEH

FOR YOU SEE,
THIS IS...
THE, INVISIBLE...
UHHHHHHH...?
HMMM... YOU MUST
BE HAVING
CULTURE SHOCK.
YOU SEE, WHERE I
COME FROM, IT'S
A LOVING TRADITION.
TO SUFFER THROUGH
HORRIBLE PUZZLES
FOR NO REASON.
SO, UH, JUST
WALK BACK THERE,
AND...
SIGH...
WHY COULDN'T WE GET
A HUMAN THAT LIKES
PUZZLES???
HUMAN!!!
I HOPE YOU'RE
READY FOR...
SANS!!

AGREE ON.
IT WAS MADE
BY THE GREAT...

SERIOUS?
SANS!!!
HELP!!!
THEY KEEP WALKING
THROUGH MY PUZZLES!
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO LET ME
EXPLAIN THEM.
THEN THREATEN AND
BAFFLE THEM WITH
DANGEROUS JAPES.
EVERYONE LIKES
JAPES!!!
SHE HATES PUZZLES.
BUT SHE LOVES
JAPES.
HUMAN!!
WHAT DO YOU
THINK!?
PUZZLES OR JAPES?
OKAY, THIS IS
NORMALLY THE
PART.
WHERE YOU EITHER
AGREE OR DISAGREE.
AND DEPENDING ON
YOUR ANSWER.
WE SAY SOMETHING
GREAT IN RESPONSE.
HERE, WHY DON'T
YOU DO THIS
PUZZLE YOURSELF.
HUMAN!
HMMM...
HOW DO I SAY
THIS...
YOU WERE TAKING A
LONG TIME TO
ARRIVE, SO...
I DECIDED TO
IMPROVE THIS
PUZZLE...
BY ARRANGING THE
SNOW TO LOOK MORE

AND YOU DID IT
ALL WITHOUT MY
HELP...
MY ADVICE HELPED!
IT REALLY HELPED
YOU!!
INCREDIBLE!
I'M IMPRESSED!!
YOU MUST CARE
ABOUT PUZZLES
LIKE I DO!
WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'LL LOVE THE
NEXT PUZZLE THEN!
IT MIGHT EVEN
BE TOO EASY FOR
YOU!!
NYEH!
HEH HEH!
HEHEHEH!!!
HUMAN!
THIS IS YOUR FINAL
AND MOST DANGEROUS
CHALLENGE!
BEHOLD!
THE GAUNTLET OF
DEADLY TERROR!
WHEN I SAY THE
WORD, IT WILL
FULLY ACTIVATE!!!
CANNONS WILL FIRE!
SPIKES WILL SWING!
BLADES WILL SLICE!
EACH PART WILL
SWING VIOLENTLY
UP AND DOWN!
ONLY THE TINIEST
CHANCE OF VICTORY
WILL REMAIN!!!
ARE YOU READY!?
I!
AM!
ABOUT!
TO DO IT!
HOLDUP!?
WHAT HOLDUP!?
I'M...
I'M ABOUT TO
ACTIVATE IT NOW!
WELL!!!
THIS CHALLENGE!!!
IT SEEMS...
MAYBE... TOO EASY
TO DEFEAT THE
HUMAN WITH.
YEAH!
WE CAN'T USE
THIS ONE!!!
I AM A SKELETON
WITH STANDARDS!!!
MY PUZZLES ARE
VERY FAIR!
AND MY TRAPS ARE
EXPERTLY COOKED!
BUT THIS METHOD
IS TOO DIRECT!
NO CLASS AT ALL!
AWAY IT GOES!
... THEY'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO WALK
THROUGH IT.
AND IT WON'T BE
ANY FUN AT ALL.
WELL. I MEAN.
I'M EXCITED TO
CAPTURE THEM.
SO I'LL BECOME
A FAMOUS ROYAL
GUARDSMAN!!!
BUT ALL THE TIME
I PUT INTO THESE
PUZZLES...
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THROWING A
BIRTHDAY PARTY...
EXACTLY!!
IT'S POINTLESS!!!
MAYBE YOU WERE
RIGHT TO BE LAZY
ABOUT PUZZLES.
YEAH!!
WHAT AM I SAYING!
YOU'RE STILL
COMPLETELY WRONG!
I JUST HAVE THE
WRONG AUDIENCE!
THINK ABOUT HOW
MUCH FUN UNDYNE
WOULD HAVE HERE!
FLAMES, VIOLENCE.
IT'S RIGHT UP HER
ALLEY!
SO I WON'T WASTE
THIS PUZZLE ON
YOU.
I JUST HAVE TO
APPRECIATE...
THE FRIEND I
ALREADY HAVE!!!
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT!?
THIS WAS ANOTHER
DECISIVE VICTORY
FOR PAPYRUS!!
NYEH!!
HEH!!
HEH???
A VALUABLE LIFE
LESSON!!!
HUMAN.
ALLOW ME TO TELL
YOU ABOUT SOME
COMPLEX FEELINGS.
SOMEHOW, I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND...
EVEN THOUGH I'VE
NEVER ACTUALLY MET
YOU BEFORE!!
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
WHY I FEEL THIS
WAY...
DID I MEET YOU
ONLINE???
I HAVE MANY "SOCIAL
MEDIA CONNECTIONS."
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
TRACK OF THEM
ALL.
JUST A DOZEN MORE,
AND...
I'LL FINALLY REACH
DOUBLE DIGITS!!!
... HEY, WAIT A
SECOND!
YOU CAN'T BE MY
FRIEND!!!
YOU'RE HUMAN!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
ALMOST TRICKED ME INTO
NOT DEFEATING YOU!!!
WHOOPSIE DOOPSIE!
FEELINGS LIKE...
THE JOY OF FINDING
ANOTHER PASTA
LOVER.
THE ADMIRATION FOR
ANOTHER'S PUZZLE-
SOLVING SKILLS.
THE DESIRE TO HAVE
A COOL, SMART PERSON
THINK YOU ARE COOL.
THESE FEELINGS...
THEY MUST BE WHAT
YOU ARE FEELING
RIGHT NOW!!!
I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE
WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE
TO FEEL THAT WAY.
AFTER ALL, I AM
VERY GREAT.
I DON'T EVER WONDER
WHAT HAVING LOTS
OF FRIENDS IS LIKE.
I PITY YOU...
LONELY HUMAN...
WORRY NOT!!!
YOU SHALL BE
LONELY NO LONGER!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS, WILL BE
YOUR...
 ...
NO...
NO, THIS IS ALL
WRONG!
I CAN'T BE YOUR
FRIEND!!!
YOU ARE A HUMAN!
I MUST CAPTURE
YOU!!!
THEN, I CAN FULFILL
MY LIFELONG DREAM!!!
POWERFUL!
POPULAR!
PRESTIGIOUS!!!
THAT'S PAPYRUS!!!
THE NEWEST MEMBER...
OF THE ROYAL GUARD!
OH...
WHERE COULD THAT
HUMAN HAVE GONE.
... WAIT...
IT'S RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME!!!
HELLO!
I WAS WORRIED THAT
YOU HAD GOTTEN LOST!
IT SURE IS A RELIEF
TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE...
... WAIT A SECOND!!!
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ESCAPE!!!
GET BACK THERE!!!
I SUPPOSE THIS PROVES
WHAT I SAID.
WE REALLY ARE BOUND
TOGETHER.
TWO BONES IN THE
SKELETAL ANATOMY OF
FATE!!!
THAT'S HOW YOU APPEAR
HERE NOW...
EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO ESCAPE.
AMAZING!!!
I FEEL A SINCERE...
WAAAAAIT A SECOND!!
I STILL HAVE TO
CAPTURE YOU!!!
WHOOPSIE-DOOPSIE!!
BACK AGAIN, EH?
I SUPPOSE IT'S MY
FAULT...
I TOLD YOU BEFORE
THAT I WOULD MAKE
YOU SPAGHETTI.
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT YOU WOULD
WANT TO SEE ME...
IN THE DIRE HOPE
THAT I WOULD MAKE
YOU SOME.
WELL... I UNDERSTAND.
PAPYRUS IS HUNGRY,
TOO!
HUNGRY FOR JUSTICE!
HALT, HUMAN!
I WAS NEVER ONE
  TO BEPIS.
OH, I ALMOST
FORGOT TO TELL
YOU...
TO REACH THE EXIT,
YOU WILL HAVE
TO PASS...
THROUGH THE KING'S
CASTLE.
TO REACH THE EXIT,
YOU WILL HAVE
TO MEET...
THE KING.
THE KING OF
ALL MONSTERS...
HE IS...
... WELL...
HE'S A BIG FUZZY
PUSHOVER!!!
EVERYBODY LOVES
THAT GUY.
I AM CERTAIN IF
YOU JUST SAY...
EXCUSE ME, MR.
DREEMURR... CAN I
PLEASE GO HOME?
HE'LL GUIDE YOU
RIGHT TO THE
BARRIER HIMSELF!
ANYWAY!!!
THAT'S ENOUGH
TALKING!!!
I'LL BE AT HOME
BEING A COOL
FRIEND!!!
FEEL FREE TO
COME BY AND
HANG OUT!!!
FEEL FREE TO
COME BY AND HAVE
THAT DATE!
NYEH HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH!!!
HEY, QUIT MOVING
WHILE I'M TALKING
TO YOU!
I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS,
HAVE SOME THINGS
TO SAY.
FIRST: YOU'RE A
FREAKING WEIRDO!
NOT ONLY DO YOU
NOT LIKE PUZZLES.
BUT THE WAY YOU
SHAMBLE ABOUT FROM
PLACE TO PLACE...
THE WAY YOUR HANDS
ARE ALWAYS COVERED
IN DUSTY POWDER.
IT FEELS...
LIKE YOUR LIFE IS
GOING DOWN A
DANGEROUS PATH.
HOWEVER!
I, PAPYRUS, SEE
GREAT POTENTIAL
WITHIN YOU!
EVERYONE CAN BE
A GREAT PERSON
IF THEY TRY!
AND ME, I HARDLY
HAVE TO TRY AT
ALL!!!
NYEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH!!!
HEY, QUIT MOVING!
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I AM TALKING
ABOUT!
HUMAN! I THINK
YOU ARE IN NEED
OF GUIDANCE!
SOMEONE NEEDS TO
KEEP YOU ON THE
STRAIGHT AND NARROW!
BUT WORRY NOT!
I, PAPYRUS...
WILL GLADLY BE
YOUR FRIEND AND
TUTOR!
I WILL TURN YOUR
LIFE RIGHT
AROUND!!!
I SEE YOU ARE
APPROACHING.
ARE YOU OFFERING A
HUG OF ACCEPTANCE?
WOWIE!! MY LESSONS
ARE ALREADY
WORKING!!
I, PAPYRUS,
WELCOME YOU
WITH OPEN ARMS!
COME ON!
DON'T BE SO
RUDE!!!
I SET UP
THIS PUZZLE
JUST FOR YOU!
DO YOU TREAT
YOUR MOTHER
THIS WAY...
WHEN SHE MAKES
YOU A PUZZLE
?!?!?
HUMANS...
SANS!!!!
THE HUMAN IS
ESCAPING!!!
YOU MADE THE
PUZZLE TOO
HARD!!
HEY YOU!!!
GET BACK HERE!
YOU KNOW WHAT
"SUP," BROTHER!
IT'S BEEN EIGHT
DAYS AND YOU
STILL HAVEN'T...
RECALIBRATED.
YOUR.
PUZZLES!
YOU JUST HANG
AROUND OUTSIDE
YOUR STATION!
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING?!?
NO!!
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT!!
WHAT IF A HUMAN
COMES THROUGH
HERE!?!
I WANT TO BE
READY!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE!
I MUST BE THE ONE!
I WILL CAPTURE A
HUMAN!
THEN, I, THE
GREAT PAPYRUS...
WILL GET
ALL THE THINGS I
UTTERLY DESERVE!
RESPECT...
RECOGNITION...
I WILL FINALLY
BE ABLE TO JOIN
THE ROYAL GUARD!
PEOPLE WILL ASK,
TO, BE MY,
"FRIEND?"
I WILL BATHE IN A
SHOWER OF KISSES
EVERY MORNING.
SANS!! YOU ARE
NOT HELPING!!
YOU LAZYBONES!!
ALL YOU DO IS SIT
AND BOONDOGGLE!
YOU GET LAZIER
AND LAZIER
EVERY DAY!!!
SANS!!!
I AM AND I HATE IT!
WHY DOES SOMEONE
AS GREAT AS ME...
HAVE TO DO SO MUCH
JUST TO GET SOME
RECOGNITION...
UGH!!!
I WILL ATTEND TO
MY PUZZLES...
AS FOR YOUR WORK?
PUT A LITTLE MORE,
"BACKBONE" INTO
IT!!!!
NYEHEHEHEHEHE
HEHEHEHEHEHE!!!
HEH!
SANS!!!
HAVE YOU FOUND A
HUMAN YET!??!
REALLY!?!?
WOWIE!!!
GUESS THAT'S
SETTLED!!
MY BROTHER STARTED
A SOCK COLLECTION
RECENTLY.
HOW SADDENING...
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT HE WOULD
DO...
WITHOUT SUCH A
COOL GUY TAKING
CARE OF HIM???
SO, YOU WANT
A HINT, HUH?
WELL...
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE PUZZLE...
AND I THINK THE
SOLUTION...
IS TO TURN ALL
OF THE X'S INTO
O'S!
YOU SHOULD TRY
THAT!
ASK AGAIN FOR
MORE GREAT HINTS!
MAYBE SOLVING
THE LAST PUZZLE 
AGAIN WILL HELP.
ASK AGAIN FOR
MORE GREAT HINTS!!
I ASKED UNDYNE
IF WE COULD
ALL HANG...
BUT SHE SAID
SOMETHING WEIRD.
SHE SAID SHE
WON'T HANG OUT
WITH A MURDERER.
BUT... HMM...
I DON'T REMEMBER
MURDERERING
ANYONE...
THOUGH I AM A
PRETTY BRUTAL
KIND OF GUY.
THEN SHE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT
WANTING TO...
FIGHT SOME KIND
OF BAD GUY.
BUT SHE SEEMS
VERY... WEAK
FROM SOMETHING.
SHE STEPPED OUT
AND COLLAPSED IN
THE DOORWAY.
SO I'M JUST
WAITING HERE IN
CASE SHE NEEDS ME.
SINCE SHE HATES
BEING WAITED ON
HAND AND FOOT.
I THINK WE'LL
HAVE TO HANG
OUT LATER...
HEY, I...
REALLY DOUBT
WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO HANG.
IT'S HARD TO
IMAGINE, BUT...
YOU'LL HAVE TO
SPEND TIME WITH
NOT ME.
HEY! READY TO
HANG OUT WITH
UNDYNE???
GREAT!!!
ME TOO!!!
HOWEVER, SHE'S
NOT HERE.
NORMALLY SHE
RETURNS AT ABOUT
THIS TIME.
SHE'S LATE
THOUGH...
AND SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER
PHONE.
HOW STRANGE.
I'LL JUST WAIT
HERE UNTIL SHE
GETS HOME.
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN SHE GETS
HERE, OKAY!?
NOPE!!
SHE ISN'T HERE
YET!!!
UNDYNE'S HOME,
BUT SHE ISN'T
FEELING WELL.
I DON'T THINK WE
CAN HANG OUT.
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE
CAUGHT HEAT-STROKE
OR SOMETHING.
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
BROUGHT HER
BACK HOME...
BECAUSE SHE CAN
BARELY MOVE.
BUT SHE IS
MUTTERING ABOUT
DESTROYING YOU.
SO THAT'S A GOOD
VITAL SIGN.
IN ANY CASE, I
DON'T THINK WE
CAN HANG OUT.
I'M JUST WAITING
HERE IN CASE
SHE NEEDS ME.
SO, I GUESS YOU
CAN RUN ALONG.
UNDYNE IS SICK,
SO SHE CAN'T
PLAY TODAY.
GREAT!!!
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
EVEN HERE.
BEING READY EARLY!
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH
YOU CARE!!
EVEN IF SHE'S
NOT HERE TO SEE
THAT.
HELLO, MY FRIEND.
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO PAPYRUS TOWN?
HELLO...
H-HOW ARE YOU,
MY F-FRIEND?
I'M FEELING VERY
NOT SUSPICIOUS
TODAY.
HEY, I HAVE A
GREAT IDEA.
LET'S HANG OUT
WITH UNDYNE
LATER.
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I'M READY!
I'M SO GLAD YOU
AND UNDYNE ARE
FRIENDS NOW.
YOU TWO GO
TOGETHER LIKE
PASTA AND BURNING!
OH, HEY...
YOU'RE LEAVING
SOON, RIGHT!?
DON'T COME HERE
TO SAY GOODBYE!!
GOODBYES AREN'T
ALLOWED IN MY
TOWN.
JUST SEE-YOU-
LATERS.
IT SEEMS UNDYNE
HAS SOMETHING
FOR YOU.
SHE'S THE PERSON
THAT'S NOT ME.
UNDYNE WRITES A
LOT OF LETTERS.
BUT, SHE CAN NEVER
SEEM TO FIND THE
RIGHT WORDS.
SO WHEN SHE GOES
TO DELIVER THEM
HERSELF...
SHE ALWAYS QUITS
SO SHE CAN GO
BACK AND REWRITE.
THAT'S WHY SHE
ASKED YOU!!
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NO STANDARDS!!!
ALPHYS SEEMS TO
HAVE DISAPPEARED.
DON'T WORRY, THAT'S
NORMAL.
YOU SHOULD GO
TO HER LAB.
I'M SUPPOSED TO
PUT THESE
NUMBERS TOGETHER.
WELCOME TO SCENIC
MY HOUSE!
ENJOY AND TAKE
YOUR TIME!!!
WOW!
BEING A GOOD HOST
IS A REAL WORKOUT!
I CAN'T FEEL MY
LEGS...
THAT MUST MEAN
I'M BEING A
GREAT HOST!!!
TAKE A LOOK
AROUND!
SO YOU CAME
BACK TO HAVE A
DATE WITH ME!
SO YOU CAME
BACK TO SEE ME!
YOU MUST BE
REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS...
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE
YOU SOMEPLACE
REALLY SPECIAL...
A PLACE I LIKE
TO SPEND A LOT
OF TIME!!!
MY HOUSE!!!
HERE, UNDYNE.
MY FRIEND BROUGHT
A GIFT FOR YOU,
ON THEIR OWN!
WHOOPSY DOOPSY!
I JUST REMEMBERED!
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM!!
YOU TWO HAVE
FUN!!!
DANG!
WHAT A SHAME...
I THOUGHT UNDYNE
COULD BE FRIENDS
WITH YOU.
BUT I GUESS...
I OVERESTIMATED
HER.
SHE'S JUST NOT
UP TO THE
CHALLENGE.
PSST.
MAKE SURE TO
GIVE HER THIS!
SHE LOVES THESE!
YOU BET I AM!
AND I BROUGHT
A FRIEND!
NO!
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
FRIENDSHIP!!
H... HI, UNDYNE!
I'M HERE WITH MY
DAILY REPORT...
UHHH... REGARDING THAT
HUMAN I CALLED YOU
ABOUT EARLIER...
I THINK, UH...
HOW DO I...
... HUH?
DID I FIGHT THEM?
Y-YES!
OF COURSE I DID!
I FOUGHT THEM
VALIANTLY!
...WHAT?
DID I CAPTURE THEM...?
W-W-WELL...
NO.
I TRIED VERY HARD,
UNDYNE, BUT IN THE
END...
I FAILED.
... W-WHAT?
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE HUMAN'S SOUL
YOURSELF...
BUT UNDYNE, YOU DON'T
H-HAVE TO DESTROY
THEM! YOU SEE...
YOU SEE...
...
...
... I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL HELP YOU IN
ANY WAY I CAN.
 
... I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL HELP YOU IN
ANY WAY I CAN.
WHAT!!
I DIDN'T CRY!!!
I DON'T CRY!!
I JUST...
CAUGHT SOMETHING
IN MY EYE.
TEARS!!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE QUEEN HAS
RETURNED...
AND ALSO THAT
SHE'S A HUGE
DORK!!!
YOU TWO ARE TWO
FEET AWAY FROM
EACH OTHER!!!
WHY ARE YOU
TEXTING!!!
WHY IS THAT.
HAHAHA, WOW!
THOSE PUNS ARE
EVEN LESS FUNNY
COMING FROM HER!
IT'S A PITY
SMILE!!!
WOW, FRISK...
THIS REALLY PUTS
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IN A NEW LIGHT.
IT'S NOT???
WHATEVER, MOM!!!
OK, UNDYNE.
I'M GETTING MIXED
  MESSAGES HERE!!!
COOKING???
CAN I HELP?
BUT YOU AREN'T
  WORKING!!!
A-ACHOO!
I HAVE NO SKIN.
BECAUSE I HATE
GREASE.
NO, BUT I HAVE
STANDARDS!!!
THE RENT'S CHEAP.
YEAH, BUT MY
BROTHER PAYS
FOR IT.
OH, THAT'S SIMPLE.
IT'S A MYSTERY.
SO, ASGORE...
HOW ABOUT MAKING
ME A MEMBER OF
THE ROYAL GUARD?
WHAT!?
THEN WHAT WAS
THE POINT OF THE
HUMAN'S QUEST!?
THEY JOURNEYED
ALL THAT WAY...
AND I'M STILL
NOT A MEMBER OF
THE ROYAL GUARD!?
TRULY, THIS IS
THE WORST
POSSIBLE ENDING.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU
REALLY BOTCHED
YOUR QUEST, FRISK.
BUT, I, THE
GREAT PAPYRUS...
WILL ALWAYS BE
YOUR FRIEND!!!
HEY!
THAT'S TRUE.
FRISK, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE A WALK
AROUND?
YEAH, FRISK, WHY
DON'T YOU FLY?
FRISK...
TAKE A HIKE.
HIKING IS GOOD
FOR YOUR BONES.
WAIT, ALPHYS, I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU
KNEW SANS.
THIS IS MY BROTHER'S
PET ROCK.
HE ALWAYS FORGETS
TO FEED IT.
AS USUAL, I HAVE
TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.
ISN'T THAT FLAG
NEATO?
UNDYNE FOUND IT
AT THE BAY...
I THINK IT'S FROM
THE HUMAN WORLD?
NOW, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING.
WHY WOULD A
HUMAN FLAG...
HAVE A COOL
SKELETON ON IT?
WELL...
I HAVE A THEORY.
I THINK HUMANS...
MUST HAVE
DESCENDED FROM
SKELETONS!!!
PLEASE DON'T ENTER
THE MYSTERIOUS
SHACK.
HELLO.
THAT'S NOT
MY HOUSE.
THAT'S JUST MY
COOL TOOLSHED.
NO!!!
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT!!!
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
FRIENDS,
UNDYNE.
YOU ENRICH MY
LIFE WITH SHED-
BASED PUNS.
READY FOR ANOTHER
NIGHT IN THE
PUNISHMENT SHACK?
READY FOR ANOTHER
NIGHT IN THE
PUNISHMENT SHACK?
DON'T BE SO
JUDGMENTAL,
UNDYNE.
MY SHACK IS A
FOUR STAR
ESTABLISHMENT.
WHAT!?!?
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
YOU SHOULD LEARN
A PRIVACY.
A CLASSIC IMAGE.
IT ALWAYS REMINDS
ME OF WHAT'S
IMPORTANT IN LIFE.
HEY, SANS, HAVE
YOU SEEN MY...
OH, HELLO.
YOU AREN'T SANS.
WAIT A SECOND.
WHY WERE YOU USING
A TREADMILL IN
THE DARK?
IS SANS PRANKING
YOU ACROSS TIME
AND SPACE?
I HATE IT WHEN
HE DOES THAT!
HOW IMMATURE CAN
YOU GET?
ALSO, HAVE YOU
SEEN MY ACTION
FIGURES?
WAIT!
I KNOW WHERE TO
LOOK!!!
IN MY COLLECTION!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
SOMETIMES, I'M A
GENIUS.
ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S THE TRASH
CAN.
FEEL FREE TO VISIT
IT ANY TIME.
AH-HA!
INTERESTED IN
MY FOOD MUSEUM?
PLEASE.
PERUSE MY
CULINARY ARTSHOW.
GREAT FRIDGE,
ISN'T IT?
THAT'S MY BED!
IF I EVER GET
TO THE SURFACE...
I'D LIKE TO
DRIVE DOWN A
LONG HIGHWAY.
WIND IN MY
HAIR...
SUN ON MY
SKIN...
OF COURSE, THAT'S
JUST A DREAM.
SO INSTEAD I
CRUISE WHILE I
SNOOZE.
WHY ARE YOU SO
INTERESTED IN MY
BED?
ARE YOU TIRED?
THAT BOOK'S ONE
OF MY
FAVORITES.
ADVANCED PUZZLE
CONSTRUCTION FOR
CRITICAL MINDS.
THAT NEXT BOOK'S
ANOTHER ONE OF
MY FAVORITES.
PEEK-A-BOO WITH
FLUFFY BUNNY.
THE ENDING
ALWAYS GETS ME.
THE INTERNET!
I'M QUITE
POPULAR THERE.
I'M JUST A
DOZEN AWAY...
FROM A DOUBLE
DIGIT FOLLOWER
COUNT!
OF COURSE, FAME
HAS A STEEP
PRICE.
A JEALOUS TROLL
HAS BESIEGED MY
ONLINE PERSONA.
ALWAYS SENDING
ME BAD PUNS IN
A GOOFY FONT...
AH, YES, ACTION
FIGURES.
A GREAT REFERENCE
FOR THEORETICAL
BATTLE SCENARIOS.
HOW DO I HAVE
SO MANY?
WELL, LET'S JUST
SAY THEY'RE
FROM...
A CHUBBY, SMILING
MAN WHO LOVES TO
SURPRISE PEOPLE.
YEAH!!
THAT'S RIGHT!
SANTA!!!!
HEY, THOSE ARE ALL
THE ATTACKS I USED
ON YOU.
GREAT MEMORIES,
HUH?
SEEMS LIKE IT
WAS ONLY
YESTERDAY...
EVEN THOUGH
IT BASICALLY
JUST HAPPENED.
HEY, THOSE ARE ALL
THE ATTACKS I
DIDN'T USE.
HOW LUCKY OF YOU!
HAD I ONLY USED
MY SPECIAL ATTACK,
YOU SURELY WOULD
HAVE BEEN BLASTED
TO...
HEY. WAIT.
WHERE'S MY SPECIAL
ATTACK?
NO! I'VE BEEN
DOGBURGLED BY THAT
PERNICIOUS PUP!
THAT LOATHESOME
SCOUNDREL LOVES TO
SNEAK INTO MY ROOM.
SOMETIMES IT EVEN
CRAWLS INTO MY BED
WHILE I'M RESTING.
IF THAT WASN'T
BAD ENOUGH, IT HAS
VERY COLD FEET.
WOW, YOU'RE SO
EAGER TO DATE
ME...
WOW, YOU'RE SO
EAGER TO HANG
OUT...
YOU'RE TRYING TO
GO INTO MY HOUSE
WITHOUT ME!
THAT'S REALLY
WEIRD!!!
IMPRESSED?
I INCREASED THE
HEIGHT OF MY SINK.
NOW I CAN FIT MORE
BONES UNDER IT!
TAKE A LOOKSY!
FORGET IT.
WHAT!?!?
CATCH THAT
MEDDLING CANINE!
CURSES!!!
STOP PLAGUING MY
LIFE WITH INCIDENTAL
MUSIC!!!
OOH, IT'S MY
FAVORITE
GAME-SHOW!
WHAT!!!
IT'S USUALLY
BETTER THAN THIS!
THIS IS JUST
A BAD EPISODE!!!
DON'T JUDGE ME!!!
HOW NICE OF YOU
TO CHECK MY MAIL
FOR ME.
WAIT, NO.
THAT'S VERY
STRANGE.
STOP LOOKING IN
MY EMPTY
MAILBOX.
THAT'S MY
EMPTINESS, NOT
YOURS.
YEAH, UNDYNE'S
GOT A POINT!
WHY DIDN'T SHE
WRITE A LETTER
TO ME INSTEAD?
OH NO!!!
WHAT'S THE F
FOR?
HEY!
NOBODY FIGHT
ANYONE!
IF ANYONE FIGHTS
ANYONE...!
THEN I'LL!!!
BE FORCED!!!

HOW DID I GET THIS
NUMBER...?
IT WAS EASY!!!
I JUST DIALED EVERYNUMBER SEQUENTIALLYUNTIL I GOT YOURS!!!
NYEH HEH HEH HEH!!
SO...
WHAT ARE YOU
WEARING...?
I'M...
ASKING FOR A
FRIEND.
SHE THOUGHT SHE
SAW YOU WEARING A
.
IS THAT TRUE?
ARE YOU WEARING A
?
SO YOU ARE WEARING
A 
...
GOT IT!!!
WINK WINK!!!
HAVE A NICE DAY!
SO YOU AREN'T
WEARING A
GOT IT!
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,
SO I TRUST YOU
100-PERCENT.
REMEMBER WHEN
I ASKED YOU
ABOUT CLOTHES?
WELL, THE FRIEND
WHO WANTED TO
KNOW...
HER OPINION OF
YOU IS VERY...
MURDERY.
ERROR!!!
SEE YOU LATER!
BUT I BET YOU
KNEW THAT
ALREADY!
AND BECAUSE YOU
KNEW THAT...
I TOLD HER WHAT
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE WEARING!
A 
!
BECAUSE I KNEW,
OF COURSE...
AFTER SUCH A
SUSPICIOUS
QUESTION...
YOU WOULD
OBVIOUSLY CHANGE
YOUR CLOTHES!
YOU'RE SUCH A
SMART COOKIE!
THIS WAY YOU'RE
SAFE AND I
DIDN'T LIE!!!
NO BETRAYAL
ANYWHERE!!!
BEING FRIENDS
WITH EVERYONE
IS EASY!!!
WELL, WORRY
NOT DEAR HUMAN!
PAPYRUS WOULD
NEVER BETRAY YOU!
I AM NOT A
CRUEL PERSON.
I STRIVE TO BE
COMFORTING AND
PLEASANT.
PAPYRUS!
HE SMELLS LIKE
THE MOON.
SO, BECAUSE OF
MY INHERENT
GOODNESS...
I TOLD HER YOU
WERE NOT WEARING
A 
EVEN THOUGH YOU
TOLD ME YOU
WERE!
INSTEAD, I MADE
SOMETHING UP!
I TOLD HER YOU
WERE WEARING...
A 
IT PAINED ME TO
TELL SUCH A
BOLDFACED LIE.
I KNOW YOU WOULD
NEVER EVER WEAR
A 
BUT YOUR SAFETY
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FASHION.
DANG!
I JUST WANT TO
BE FRIENDS WITH
EVERYONE...
PAPYRUS WOULD
NEVER BETRAY YOU!
YOU SAID YOU WERE 
NOT WEARING A
.
SO OF COURSE
I ACTUALLY
TOLD HER...
YOU WERE
INDEED WEARING
A 
BUT SINCE YOU
AREN'T WEARING
A 
SHE SURELY
WON'T ATTACK
YOU!
NOW YOU ARE
SAFE AND SOUND.
WOWIE...
THIS IS HARD.
I JUST WANT TO
BE EVERYBODY'S
FRIEND!
I KNEW WHEN
YOU SAID:
"I AM NOT
WEARING A
."
IT WAS REALLY
A SECRET CODE!
YOU REALLY
MEANT...
"I ACTUALLY AM
WEARING
A 
!"
YOU WERE TRYING
TO PROTECT
YOURSELF...
WHILE MAKING IT
SO I DIDN'T
HAVE TO LIE!
I PICKED UP ON
THIS, AND FOLLOWED
YOUR PLAN.
IN FACT I TOOK
IT ONE STEP
FURTHER!
I TOLD HER YOU
WERE PROBABLY...
WEARING A
OF COURSE, YOU
WOULD NEVER
WEAR THAT.
BUT THAT'S THE
POINT!
SHE WON'T
RECOGNIZE YOU
NOW!
AND I DIDN'T
HAVE TO BETRAY
EITHER OF YOU!
SINCE I JUST
TOLD HER WHAT
YOU SAID!
WOWIE!
YOU'RE SUCH A
SMART COOKIE!
I REALLY CAN
BE FRIENDS WITH
EVERYONE!!!
HEY!
WHAT'S UP!?
I WAS JUST
THINKING...
YOU, ME, AND
UNDYNE SHOULD ALL
HANG OUT SOMETIME!
I THINK YOU
WOULD MAKE
GREAT PALS!
LET'S MEET UP
AT HER HOUSE
LATER!
AFTER YOU HANG
OUT WITH ME...
LET'S MEET UP
AT HER HOUSE!
HMMMM...
THE STRANGE DOOR
IN THE WOODS.
ACTUALLY,
MY BROTHER SPENDS
A LOT OF TIME HERE.
WHAT'S HE DOING...?
I'VE GOT TO KEEP
HIM ON THE STRAIGHT
AND NARROW!!!
ARE YOU STILL
AROUND THAT DOOR?
OH NO!!!
MY BROTHER'S A
BAD INFLUENCE!!!
THIS IS WHERE MY
BROTHER IS SUPPOSED
TO PATROL...
BUT, EVERY TIME I
SHOW UP, HE'S
SLACKING OFF.
IT'S A GOOD THING
I SPOTTED YOU
FIRST!
I'M SURE HE WOULD
HAVE MADE A WEIRD
FIRST IMPRESSION.
IF HE'S NOT AROUND,
HE WON'T COME
BACK...
THAT'S JUST THE
WAY HE FUNCTIONS.
WHAT???
ARE YOU LOST???
HMMM... YOU SHOULD
TRY CALLING
SOMEONE FOR HELP!
HUH???
WHY ARE YOU
CALLING ME??
IT'S TOO COLD
TO SWIM IN THE
RIVER.
UNLESS YOU HAVE A
WATERPROOF
SWEATER!
IT'S JUST A
RIVER.
NYEH HEH HEH!!
IMPRESSED!?!
NOT ONLY AM I
GREAT AT PUZZLES...
BUT I'M ALSO
AN ESTEEMED
ARCHITECT!!!
MY BROTHER HELPED
ME FIND THE BOX!
THE STATION OF
DOGGO.
HE HAS THE AMAZING
POWER TO SEE THINGS
WHEN THEY MOVE.
OKAY, MAYBE IT'S
NOT AN AMAZING
POWER.
DOGGO'S NOT HOME.
CAREFUL!!
THE ICE IS
SLPPERY.
BUT IF YOU SLIDE
ON THE ICE, NO ONE
WILL ATTACK YOU.
NO ONE WANTS TO
PRATFALL DURING A
COOL TECHNIQUE.
I'M COLD OUT OF
THINGS TO SAY.
IT MUST BE TOUGH
BEING A SNOWMAN.
TRY TO BE NICE
TO PEOPLE MADE OF
STRANGE MATERIALS.
IS THAT SNOWMAN
STILL THERE?
OH HO!
THE ELECTRIC MAZE!
THAT SURE WAS FUN!
EXCEPT FOR WHEN
I GOT SHOCKED.
OH HO!
THE ELECTRIC MAZE!
A GREAT PUZZLE!
EXCEPT FOR THE
PART WHERE WE
DIDN'T EVEN DO IT.
MINUS THAT ONE
TINY FLAW, IT'S AN
EASY 10 OUT OF 10!
DISAPPOINTING, BUT
I TURNED OFF THE
ELECTRICITY.
THE FAMOUS SNOWDIN
SNOWBALL GAME.
FASTER COMPLETION
GIVES DIFFERENT
PRIZES.
WHERE DOES THE
MONEY COME FROM?
THE SNOWBALL TAX,
OF COURSE!!
WHAT?
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF A SNOWBALL TAX?
THE SURFACE WORLD
MUST BE PARADISE...
THE STATION OF THE
MARRIED DOGS...
HMMM. DO YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT DOING
THAT SOMEDAY?
MARRYING A DOG?
NAH...
THAT'S WEIRD.
THERE ARE WAY
BETTER ANIMALS TO
MARRY.
LIKE SKELETONS!!!
HMM... CROSSWORD.
I GUESS IT'S AN
APT NAME.
THOSE WORDS MAKE
ME CROSS!!!
ARE YOU STILL
LOOKING AT THAT
WORD SEARCH?
AH, THE SPAGHETTI
TRAP ROOM...
ERROR????
I STILL HAVE TO
GO VISIT IT...
THE SPAGHETTI YOU
LEFT ME IS STILL
THERE!!!
WELL, I GUESS IT'S
NOT MUCH OF A
TRAP ANYMORE...
SINCE YOU ATE THE
WHOLE THING,
RIGHT!?
NOTHING LIKE A
HOT BUCKET OF
SPAGH...
THIS ROOM IS
NORMALLY BLOCKED
BY THOSE SPIKES.
BUT WE'RE THINKING
OF GETTING RID
OF THEM...
THE KING RELEASED
A MANDATE ON
PUZZLES RECENTLY.
HE THINKS SPIKES
ARE INEFFECTIVE AND
HAZARDOUS TO KIDS.
BUT I THINK HE'S
WRONG!!!
KIDS LOVE DEADLY
SPIKES!!!
IF YOU KNOW ANY
KIDS, YOU SHOULD
ASK THEM!!!
HMMM...
THE SOLUTION TO
THIS ONE...?
I ACTUALLY JUST
STEPPED OVER THE
SPIKES.
SO THE SOLUTION
IS TO BE VERY
TALL AND HANDSOME.
I'M SOLVING IT
AS WE SPEAK...
OH-HO!!! 
THIS PUZZLE!
YOU FIGURED IT OUT
SO EASILY!!
THAT WAS VERY
PAPYRUS OF YOU.
TALKING ON THE
PHONE... HOW
PAPYRUS OF YOU.
OH-HO!!!
THE PUZZLE THAT
DR. ALPHYS MADE!
I HAD TO ASK
UNDYNE TO ASK
HER TO MAKE ONE.
I ONLY FOLLOW
HER ONLINE...
I'M NOT REALLY
FRIENDS WITH HER...
YET!!!!
SOMEDAY I'LL
IMPRESS HER WITH
MY HUGE BICEPS...
THAT'S A GOOD
WAY TO MAKE
FRIENDS!!!
THE STATION OF
LESSERDOG.
THIS DOG LOVES
TO BE PET.
THAT'S ITS DEFINING
PERSONALITY
TRAIT.
WAIT, WHY ARE THEY
A ROYAL GUARD
AND NOT ME!?
I LOVE TO BE
PET TOO!!!
SIGH...
IT'S ALL JUST A
PUPULARITY CONTEST.
WE WERE GETTING
BORED WAITING
FOR YOU...
SO I BUILT A
SNOW-PAPYRUS!
AND SANS...
DID HIS THING.
ACTUALLY, IT'S ONE
OF HIS BETTER
LUMPS.
I ALWAYS JUMP OVER
THE GAP INSTEAD OF
SOLVING THE PUZZLE.
SANS NEVER SOLVES
IT EITHER.
HE ALWAYS JUST...
UM...
GETS ACROSS.
I THINK HE HAS
A SHORTCUT OR
SOMETHING.
GYFTROT LIVES NEAR
THERE.
THEY LIKE GIFTS.
DON'T WORRY IF
YOU CAN'T AFFORD
SOMETHING NICE.
IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.
SO IMAGINE YOU
HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY...
DID YOU MEET
GYFTROT?
MY SIGNAL IS
GETTING WEAK.
LOOKS LIKE THE
PHONE WON'T WORK
PAST HERE.
SO THERE'S NO
REASON TO GO
FURTHER.
HELLO.
THE STATION OF
GREATERDOG.
HE LOOKS A BIT
LIKE A CERTAIN DOG
I DON'T LIKE.
BUT GREATERDOG
DOESN'T COLLECT
ANYTHING.
HE'S ONLY A
KLEPTOMANIAC
FOR AFFECTION!
HE'S AMASSED A
LARGE COLLECTION
OF HUGS AND PETS.
THIS BRIDGE LOOKS
DANGEROUS, BUT
IT'S VERY STABLE.
IN FACT, IT'S JUST
A ROCK FORMATION
I PAINTED OVER.
I THINK IT LOOKS
MORE DRAMATIC
THAT WAY.
I ADDED THE ROPE,
TOO.
SNOWDIN...
HOME OF PAPYRUS!
THAT'S THE SLOGAN,
RIGHT???
I'M PETITIONING TO
CHANGE THE SLOGAN.
THAT FURRY PERSON
THROWS ICE ALL
DAY.
NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE IT GOES.
NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE IT GOES.
WOW, UNDYNE!!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
LIKED NERDY STUFF!
JUST STRENGTH
AND FIGHTING...
HYPNOTIZING, ISN'T
IT???
THE INN'S A
GREAT PLACE
TO STAY.
THE LADY WHO
RUNS IT IS
REALLY NICE.
SHE ALWAYS GIVES
ME A LOLLIPOP AND
A PAT ON THE HEAD.
WHY ARE YOU
CALLING ME?
ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE A
RESERVATION???
GRILLBY'S...
IT'S DARK AND FULL
OF GREASE.
PURGATORY OF
FRIES...
HAMBURGER ABYSS...
ANYWAY, MY BROTHER
PRACTICALLY LIVES
HERE.
I'M NOT COMING
TO GRILLBY'S.
GRILLBY'S? WE'RE TOO
REFINED FOR THAT
GREASEHOLE.
JUST MONOLOGUING
ABOUT MY LOVE
FOR GREASE!!!
OUR FEELINGS FOR
GREASE RUN DEEP
LIKE A RIVER.
I LOVE THE LIBRARY.
THE BOOKS ARE ALL
ARRANGED BY COLOR..
THIS SENSE OF
ORDER!!! IT FILLS
ME WITH POWER!
WHAT'S A LIBRARY
CARD?
WOW! IT ONLY TOOK
YOU FOUR SECONDS
TO CALL ME!!
YOU MUST BE VERY
DESPERATE FOR MY
HELP!!!
WELL! DO NOT FEAR!
THIS IS PAPYRUS'S
HOTFUL HELPLINE!
JUST DESCRIBE YOUR
LOCATION, AND...!
I WILL DESCRIBE
SOME HOT TIPS!
SO, WHERE ARE
YOU?
...
... YOU'RE STILL
IN MY ROOM??
HAVE YOU HEARD OF
SOMETHING CALLED
A... DOOR?
WAIT! DON'T WORRY!
I'LL DRAW A
DIAGRAM FOR YOU!
HOLD UP!
I'M STILL DRAWING!
WHAT? I THOUGHT
YOU HAD GOTTEN OUT
OF MY ROOM.
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO START OVER
FROM SQUARE ONE!
FIRST: DO YOU
KNOW WHO PAPYRUS
IS!?
DO I KNOW WHO
PAPYRUS IS!?
YOU'RE IN MY
HOUSE.
GOOD CHOICE!
THOUGH I GUESS
IT'S TECHNICALLY
SANS'S HOUSE TOO.
BUT I PREFER NOT
TO DISCUSS HIS
PART OF IT.
HIS ROOM IS...
IT'S LIKE ANOTHER
WORLD!
A WORLD WHERE
THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO VACUUM.
YOU'RE BEST
STAYING AWAY FROM
THAT STRANGE PLACE.
THIS IS WHERE
I TRIED TO
CAPTURE YOU!
WHAT A TERRIBLE
MEMORY!
...
SNOW WRESTLING IS
WHEN SHE SNEAKS UP
ON YOU FROM BEHIND,
THEN TACKLES YOU
AND YELLS
"SNOW-WRESTLING!"
IT'S...
NOT THE BEST
GAME.
WHAT?
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
WATERFALL...
I BARELY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
BUT I'LL DO MY
BEST TO INFORM
YOU!!!
UH, I DON'T HAVE
ANY FACTS ABOUT
THIS ROOM.
BUT I WILL!!
WHAT!?
THERE'S A RUB?
WHERE!?!?
I'LL DO MY
BEST TO FIND
THE RUB.
OOH, WHERE?
AND WHAT'S THIS
HORRIBLE NOOGIE?
MY BROTHER HAS
A STATION HERE.
YES, HE MANS
TWO STATIONS AT
ONCE.
AMAZING, ISN'T
HE?
HE SLACKS OFF
TWICE AS MUCH
AS NORMAL!!
NORMAL FOLKS CAN
ONLY DREAM OF
SUCH SLOTH...
ROCKS?
IT MUST BE ONE
OF UNDYNE'S
INGENIOUS PUZZLES.
YOU'D BETTER BE
CAREFUL!!!
BE WARY OF ROCKS.
WHERE'D YOU GO!?
I CAN'T SEE
YOU!!!
OH WAIT, THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ON THE PHONE.
ARE YOU STILL
ON THE PHONE?
WOWIE, I HAD AN
AWKWARD TIME IN
THIS ROOM EARLIER.
GOOD HEAVENS
YOU WEREN'T AROUND
TO SEE IT!!
YOU REALLY
DIDN'T SEE IT!
I LOVE THAT
FACT, AND
REPEATING IT!
A BRIDGE GROWS
IF YOU ALIGN
FOUR BRIDGE SEEDS.
BUT THAT'S SORT
OF LIMITED IN
USEFULNESS.
WHY DON'T WE
HAVE AIRPLANE
SEEDS???
OR, PHONES THAT
CAN TURN INTO
JETPACKS???
HMMM... THIS PUZZLE...
I'VE GOT IT!!!
TRY TO BUILD A
BRIDGE WITH THE
BRIDGE SEEDS!!
I'M HELPING.
WHAT'S BETTER
THAN A BENCHFUL
OF QUICHE?
THE WISHING ROOM.
DO YOU HAVE
A WISH...?
NYEH HEH HEH!!
I HAVE ONE!!!
I WISH I WAS
TALKING TO MY
COOL FRIEND!!!
LOOK!!!
IT'S COMING TRUE!
WHAT WILL YOU
WISH FOR?
I WISH I HAD
EIGHT LEGS...
SO I COULD WEAR
FOUR PAIRS OF
HOTPANTS.
THERE ARE MANY
ANCIENT PLAQUES
HERE.
WATERFALL IS
PRACTICALLY A
HISTORY MUSEUM.
EXCEPT WITH
MUSCULAR
SEAHORSES.
HI?
ANOTHER HARMLESS
AND VERY SAFE
CORRIDOR...
ALL THANKS TO
ME!!!
NYEH HEH HEH!!
HEH!!!!!
WATCH YOUR STEP!
UNDYNE REALLY CARES
ABOUT THIS GRASS
FOR SOME REASON.
ARE YOU WATCHING?
WHY ARE THERE SO
MANY TABLES LYING
AROUND HERE?
HUH? SANS ISN'T
PLAYING WITH HIS
TELESCOPE?
WOWIE!!! MAYBE HE
WENT TO WORK!!!
WOW!!! AM I
ALLOWED TO BE
PROUD???
HUH? MY BROTHER?
OF COURSE HE HAS
A TELESCOPE.
SANS LOVES
OUTER SPACEY
SCI-FI STUFF.
HMM?
HE NEVER TOLD
YOU??
YEAH, SANS NEVER
TELLS ANYBODY
ANYTHING!
THANKS FOR CALLING.
ICE CREAM?
THANKS, BUT I
LIVE IN SNOWDIN!
THERE'S ICE CREAM
ALL OVER THE
GROUND!!!
SANS!!! I DIDN'T
ASK YOUR OPINION!!
I'M FLATTERED HOW
MUCH YOU WANT TO
GIVE ME ICE CREAM.
NO YOU AREN'T!!
SOMETIMES, PRIZES
ARE HIDDEN UNDER
THE GRASS.
TREASURES LIKE
MUD, OR DIRT.
DID YOU FIND
THE TREASURE?
A BIRD MONSTER??
TRY TALKING TO
IT!!!
OR YOU COULD
PUT ME ON THE
LINE!
I'VE GOT SOME
PRETTY GOOD
TWEETS.
(HORRIBLE
  BIRD IMITATIONS)
DID THE BIRD LIKE
MY TWEETS???
ONION?
HUM HUM HUM...
I'VE HEARD A SHY
MONSTER LIVES
AROUND HERE.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO GET SOMEONE
TO OPEN UP...
YOU SHOULD ENGAGE
THEM IN COMBAT!!!
HUH!?
ARE YOU SERENADING
ME!?
OH NO!!!
YOU'RE MAKING ME
BLUSH!!!
LET'S WRITE A
MUSICAL ABOUT
OUR ADVENTURES!!!
HMMM...
THERE'S SOMETHING
ANNOYING ABOUT
THIS ROOM.
BUT I CAN'T
QUITE PLACE MY
FINGER ON IT...
THEN PLACE MY
WHOLE HAND ON
IT...
THEN PET IT
AFFECTIONATELY...
A MYSTERIOUS
STATUE...
WHAT'S THAT MUSIC?
AM I ON HOLD???
ALWAYS CARRY AN
UMBRELLA IN CASE
IT RAINS!
YOU KNOW.
JUST KEEP A FEW
IN YOUR POCKETS.
NOTHING LIKE A
HOT BUCKET OF
'BRELLAS...
YOU CAN SEE YOUR
REFLECTION IN A
PUDDLE, BUT...
DON'T LET A BODY
OF WATER DETERMINE
YOUR SELF-WORTH!!!
HMMM? YOU'RE
HANGING OUT
WITH A FRIEND?
THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T TALK
TO ME...
YOU'LL MAKE THEM
JEALOUS!
CALLING AGAIN...?
WHERE ARE YOU?
I HEAR WATER.
ARE YOU IN THE
TOILET?
ALSO, WHAT'S A
TOILET?
THAT'S THE KING'S
CASTLE...
SEEMS YOU CAN
FINALLY SEE THE
END.
SEEMS LIKE THE
PHONE CONNECTION'S
GETTING WEAK...
BETTER NOT GO
PAST THAT POINT.
FLOWERS...?
DO ANY OF THEM
TALK!?
SAY HI FOR ME!!!
FLOWERS ARE OUR
BEST FRIENDS!!
GARBAGE, HUH?
BOY, DO I KNOW
GARBAGE!!
AFTER ALL, I'M
HOUSEMATES WITH A
LAZY BAG OF TRASH!
HIS NAME'S TRASHY.
HE LIVES IN THE
GARBAGE CAN.
YOU DIDN'T THINK I
DIDN'T NAME MY
GARBAGE, DID YOU?
I KNOW WHY YOU
CALLED ME.
I ALWAYS MAKE
PEOPLE FEEL
BETTER...
WHEN THEY'RE DOWN
IN THE DUMPS!!!
...
I'VE SPENT TOO
LONG WITH MY
BROTHER TODAY.
FORGET I SAID
THAT.
HEY!
YOU'RE NEAR
UNDYNE'S HOUSE!
THAT'S TO THE
LEFT-UPWARDS.
LUPWARDS.
ALL THE OTHER
DIRECTIONS GO TO
THE WRONG HOUSE.
NORTH:
GHOST HOUSE.
EAST: TURTLE HOUSE.
SOUTH:
TRASH HOUSE.
WEST: BIRD HOUSE.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
NEAR UNDYNE'S
HOUSE.
HEY!
WE SHOULD GO
VISIT UNDYNE!
I LOVE WHEN A PLAN
COMES TOGETHER!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
REALLY???
CAN WE???
THAT'S UNDYNE'S
HOUSE.
LET'S GO THERE
AND HANG OUT
SOME DAY!!!
STILL WAITING
OUTSIDE HER
HOUSE...?
YEAH, I DO THAT
SOMETIMES, TOO!
YOU KNOW, THE
ONE WITH THE
SKELETON IN FRONT.
IT'S A GREAT
PLACE TO...
UHHH?
HI UNDYNE!
HOW'D YOU GET
HERE SO FAST?
WOWIE!!!
UNDYNE!!!
SOMEDAY I WANT
TO BE AS STRONG
AND SWEATY AS YOU.
SO YOU RAN HERE
JUST TO BE ON
THE PHONE???
THEN YOU MUST
HAVE SOMETHING...
EXTREMELY COOL
TO SAY ABOUT
YOUR HOUSE!!!
OH, THAT'S THE
HOUSE OF... UM...
UNDYNE'S NEIGHBOR.
WHAT WAS THEIR
NAME AGAIN?
SPOOKY BLOO BLOO?
NAPPER HOG...?
SO YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH A GHOST...
ISN'T THAT KIND
OF SPOOKY?
I'D THINK YOU'D
LIKE YOUR FRIENDS
WARM AND CUDDLY...
LIKE SKELETONS!!!
VERY SOFT, AND
FULL OF CALCIUM.
THAT HOUSE USED
TO BE HAUNTED.
BECAUSE A GHOST
LIVED THERE.
BUT THE GHOST
MOVED AWAY.
IT'S AN
UN-HAUNTED HOUSE.
BY THE BY,
BREAKING INTO
A HOUSE...
THAT'S ILLEGAL,
RIGHT???
PLEASE STOP
COMMITTING GHOST
CRIMES.
HAPPSTABLOOK,
THE HAPPY
GHOST.
IT'S NOT WRONG.
IT'S JUST MY
HEADCANON.
THESE SNAILS ARE
JUST LIKE MY
BROTHER.
ROUND, SLOW...
AND CONSTANTLY
EMITTING SLIME???
EMITTING SLIME...
THAT'S JUST WHAT
BROTHERS DO.
IF YOU SEE A
SHOP, YOU SHOULD
STOP...
DROP, AND
ROLL...
INTO SOME
GREAT DEALS!!
BECAUSE WE'RE
HAVING A FIRE
SALE!!
AT MY IMAGINARY
STORE, WHICH
SELLS FLAMES.
YET ANOTHER DREAM
OF MINE.
IS THE RIVER
PERSON THERE
TODAY?
ARE THEY?
WHAT'S THAT
STRANGE WHISPER?
I MIGHT HAVE
TO HANG UP.
PAPYRUS ISN'T
HOME RIGHT NOW!!
WHAT?
MUSHROOMS?
CAN YOU EAT THEM?
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN'T EAT
THEM???
I'D TRY EATING
THEM.
LANTERNS?
UM, OKAY...
CAN YOU EAT
THEM???
I'M SERIOUSLY OUT
OF IDEAS HERE.
HMMM...
A CORRIDOR FILLED
WITH WATER.
THAT'S JUST A
GUESS.
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY.
UNDYNE???
OH.
I WAS JUST GOING
TO ASK.
DO YOU WANT TO
PRACTICE MONOLOGUES
TOGETHER...?!!
ATTENTION EVERYONE!
I AM GOING TO
OPEN THE FRIDGE!
ECHO FLOWERS...
THERE'S ONLY ONE
TALKING FLOWER
FOR ME!!
EACH AREA HAS TO
HAVE A PRECARIOUS
BRIDGE.
IT'S MANDATED BY
THE GOVERNMENT.
OF COURSE, KING
FLUFFYBOY WANTS TO
UNMANDATE IT SAFER.
WHY!!? WON'T HE
THINK OF THE
CHILDREN!?
SPIKES. DANGER
BRIDGES. THE
PILLARS OF YOUTH.
THIS IS WHERE
ELDER PUZZLER
LIKES TO STAND.
BLOCK-PUSHING.
KEY-GATHERING.
TEDIOUS AGONY.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
RESPECT OUR ROOTS!
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
RESPECT OUR
PUZZLING ROOTS.
BUT UNDYNE, DON'T
YOU LIKE TRADITION?
WHAT!? YOU THREW
AWAY MY DREAM
LIFE!!!
THE LIFE OF A
SIMPLE SALARYMAN...
COMMUTING EVERY
DAY ON A TRAIN
FULL OF SPIKES...
UNDYNE, DID YOU
REALLY HAVE AN
OFFICE JOB?
THAT'S UNDYNE!!
ALWAYS HELPING OUT
THE COMMUNITY!
THAT'S UNDYNE'S
DRAMATIC CRAG.
SHE'S ALWAYS
POSING ATOP IT.
MUMBLING SOMETHING
TO HERSELF...
I THINK IT'S
SOMETHING SHE
HAS TO MEMORIZE.
NOW I WANT A
SCRAPBOOK OF
MY FIGHT TOO!!!
ONE WEEK LATER,
SAMPLE GLOSSIES
IN THE MAIL.
HEY... ISN'T THIS
WHERE I CALLED
YOU?
I HAVE A PHOTO-
GRAPHIC MEMORY
FOR PHONE CALLS.
HEY, WHEN ARE
WE GONNA HANG
WITH UNDYNE?
HEY, WHEN ARE
WE GONNA HANG
WITH UNDYNE?
OH!
THAT WAS ME!
I WAS JUST
SAYING WE SHOULD
ALL HANG OUT.
WELL!!
NOBODY STARTS AS
GREAT FRIENDS!
THAT'S THE RULE.
N... NO!!!
NOT THE FLATTERY
SUPLEX!!!
OH!!!
YOU'RE IN HOTLAND
NOW!!!
... HEY SANS,
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE?
PHEW!
FINALLY, SANS IS
DOING HIS JOB.
HE'S GOTTEN REALLY
OUT OF SHAPE.
HE TIRES EASILY.
LATELY HE'S BEEN
NAPPING OVER 7
HOURS A NIGHT...
HE'S NAPPING
HIMSELF INTO AN
EARLY GRAVE!!
UNDYNE!! NO!!!
NOT YOU TOO!!!
I'M USUALLY TOO
BUSY TO SLEEP.
WHY???
A WATER COOLER...?
IN HOTLAND???
THAT'S WEIRD.
SHOULDN'T IT BE
A FIRE COOLER
INSTEAD?
WHAT'S A WATER
COOLER DO,
ANYWAY?
MAKE WATER...
COOLER?
SO IT GIVES IT
SPIKES AND MAKES
IT GLOW?
A LAB???
MY BROTHER
WOULD LOVE THAT!
HE LOVES SCIENCE
FICTION!!
ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT'S
REAL.
WAIT, THAT BAG OF
DOG FOOD LOOKS
FAMILIAR...
I REMEMBER SEEING
IT...
IN SANS'S ROOM?
YEAH! I ASKED HIM
WHY HE HAD IT!
HE TOLD ME HE
WAS TRYING TO
EAT HEALTHIER.
YOU'RE IN HER
ROOM, UNINVITED?
WOWIE...
THAT'S EXTREMELY
CREEPY.
MAYBE DON'T DO
THAT.
HOTLAND, HUH...
I KNOW IT LIKE
THE BACK OF
MY HAND...
WHICH, SINCE I'M
ALWAYS WEARING
GLOVES...
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT!!!
MY KNOWLEDGE
QUANTITY IS
STAGNANT.
NEITHER OF US
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HOTLAND.
ZERO PLUS ZERO
IS STILL ZERO.
HEY, YOU SHOULD
COME TO SNOWDIN
AND VISIT ME!
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON A FEW THINGS.
A FEW SENTENCES
TO STAND AROUND
AND REPEAT.
A FEW SENTENCES
TO STAND AROUND
AND REPEAT.
WHAT???
WE'RE IN THE
SAME LOCATION!!
CONVEYOR BELTS
EVERYWHERE??
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
IMAGINE RIDING
ONE TO GET TO
WORK OR SCHOOL.
RIDICULOUS.
NOW ICE AND
SPIKES, THERE'S
CONVENIENCE!!!
GLAD I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND.
DID YOU HURL??
STOP CALLING AND
MAKING HER SAY
GROSS THINGS.
STEAM VENTS?
WOW... THAT
SOUNDS AWFUL.
WHAT IF YOU'RE
WEARING A
DRESS?
GLAD I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND!!
ORANGE AND BLUE
LASERS, HUH?
JUST KEEP IN
MIND WHAT THE
COLORS MEAN.
BLUE MEANS
JUMP...
AND ORANGE MEANS
YOU'LL... SMELL
LIKE ORANGES.
THAT'S WHAT I
REMEMBER.
HAVE FUN!!
ZOINKS!!!
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST AN EXCUSE
TO TALK TO HER.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS WEATHER
DOWN HERE!!!
WOWIE!!!
WILL I NEED
AN UMBRELLA?
IT'S OKAY, I
FORGIVE YOU!
(PSST, WHEN WAS
SHE MAD AT ME?)
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
STAY IN SCHOOL.
A REAL TEACHER...
WOULD NEVER ACCEPT
DEADLY LASERS AS
AN EXCUSE!!
GLAD!
I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND!!
OH NO!
THE PUZZLES
REACTIVATING...
CAUSED THOSE
PEOPLE TO MISS
THEIR WORK!?
OH MY GOD!!!
SANS, GO DO YOUR
JOB(S)!!!
GLAD,
I DON'T
LIVE IN HOTLAND.
THEN WHY ARE
YOU SKIPPING
WORK!?!
I HEARD YOU GOT
TO MEET METTATON!!
IS THAT TRUE!?
CAN YOU GET ME
AN AUTOGRAPH!?
HE'S MY FAVORITE
SEXY RECTANGLE!!
I WISH I LIVED
IN HOTLAND!!!
WH-WHAT?
BUT HE'S SO
POPULAR...
WELL, YOU CAN
SAY THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE POPULAR.
YOU'RE POPULAR
WITH ME!!!
AWW, WOWIE!!
WAIT...
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME...?
WHAT? MY BROTHER'S
ACTUALLY AT HIS
STATION?
BUT SOMEHOW, HE'S
SELLING HOTDOGS
INSTEAD?
SLACKING OFF BY
DOING WORK...
TRULY MY BROTHER
IS A MASTER.
NO FURTHER
COMMENT.
NO, HE HAS...
AT LEAST FOUR?
MY BROTHER ISN'T
EVEN THERE???
WASN'T HE SLACKING
OFF BY SELLING
HOTDOGS?
NOW HE'S SLACKING
OFF FROM SLACKING
OFF...
WHAT? YOU HAVE TO
SOLVE A PUZZLE
ON THE CONVEYORS?
THAT GOES AGAINST
PUZZLE DESIGN
101...
CONVEYORS ARE
AWFUL AND SHOULD
NEVER BE USED!!!
GLAD I DON'T
LIVE ON CONVEYOR
PLANET!!!
WHAT... IS IT?
I HATE THIS.
I'M GONNA HANG
UP NOW!!!
SO THE ARROWS
FLIP WHEN YOU
DO WHAT?
I CAN'T VISUALIZE
THIS PUZZLE AT
ALL.
CAN YOU DRAW
A PICTURE???
THEN HOLD IT UP
TO THE RECEIVER??
DID YOU DRAW IT
YET?
WHAT? HOW'S THIS
PUZZLE WORK?
UMMM...
WHOOPS, I THINK
IT'S UNDYNE'S TURN
TO TALK!!!
WELL, ALPHYS MADE
THE PUZZLE,
RIGHT?
YOU SHOULD JUST
CALL HER UP...
AND SAY IN A
HOT VOICE...
ALPHYS...
I NEED HELP WITH
A...
(AUDIBLE WINK)
PUZZLE...
FINE!!!
GIVE ME HER
NUMBER!!!
I'LL DO THE HOT
VOICE!!!
(AUDIBLE WINK)...
WAIT, WHOSE NUMBER
IS THIS???
THE ROYAL GUARD
PATROLS THAT
AREA.
YES, LIKE SNOWDIN,
HOTLAND HAS ROYAL
GUARD MEMBERS.
WATERFALL DOESN'T
NEED THEM BECAUSE
IT'S GOT UNDYNE!!!
DID YOU SEE
THEM?
I LOVE THE NEWS!
IT'S SO
INFORMATIVE...
AND FULL OF CUT-
THROAT, EXPLOSIVE
ACTION!!!
KA-WOWIE!
THE CORE...
YOU'RE GETTING
CLOSE, HUH...?
IT MIGHT SOUND
WEIRD THAT SPIDERS
NEED DONATIONS.
BUT THINK ABOUT
IT, THEY HAVE
EIGHT FEET.
THAT'S FOUR PAIRS
OF SHOES.
A SPIDER WEARING
FOUR PAIRS OF
PINK BOOTIES.
MEDITATE ON
THIS IMAGE.
OM...
THE ENTIRE ROOM
IS COVERED IN
STEAM THINGIES?
OH MY GOD, CAN'T
YOU JUST TAKE
A BUS!?!?
HOTLAND STINKS...
DON'T TELL ME
MORE OF THIS
GARBAGE.
A WHOLE ROOM
COVERED IN VENTS?
OH NO...
OH MY GOD!!!
I HATE THIS!?!?
ITS BEST IF YOU
DON'T ENCOURAGE
HER.
LASERS ON
CONVEYORS?
NO THANKS.
SOUNDS LIKE MY
LEAST FAVORITE
NIGHTMARE.
LASERS ON
CONVEYORS? ARE
YOU SERIOUS???
OH MY GOD???
NO???
WHY????
I THOUGHT YOU
HATED MAKING
UP PUZZLES!!
PLEASE STOP
ENCOURAGING
HER.
WHERE DID THAT
TABLE COME FROM?
DOES IT BELONG
TO THE MOUSE??
EH???
MAYBE THEY BELONG
TO THE MOUSE.
TO PUT THE
CHEESE ON.
OH MY GOD!!!
GET OUT OF
HERE!!!
WAIT, DOES IT
COME FROM MILK??
WOW!!!
THAT CHOREOGRAPHY!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M FRIENDS...
WITH A BONE-A-
FIDE OPERA
STAR!!!
WOWIE!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT TO DANCE
WITH METTATON!
IS DEATH COOL?
I WANT TO MEET
DEATH...
WHAT?
I? SCREAM?
SURE!
I'LL TRY.
A. A. A. A. A.
I'M SCREAMING VERY
SLOWLY.
A.
I ALMOST CAPTURED
YOU...
WHERE'S MY ICE
CREAM.
A HOT-L...
THAT'S SHORT FOR
HOTLAND, RIGHT?
REALLY??
ME NEITHER.
YEAH!!
LET'S VACATION TO
A HOTEL!!!
OH, I WAS BEING
SARCASTIC.
I WOULD NEVER
TAKE A VACATION
FOR ANY REASON.
A FANCY
SCHMANCY
RESTAURANT!?!?
AFTER TASTING MY
COOKING, THAT SEEMS
POINTLESS, RIGHT?
I BET THEY CAN'T
EVEN MAKE
SPAGHETTI!
PSHHHHHHT.
WHO NEEDS THAT!
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
GREAT CHEFS!
ISN'T FRIENDSHIP
DELICIOUS?
CAREFUL.
LOTS OF HOTELS ARE
INFESTED NOWADAYS.
THEY CAN SLIDE
UNDER CLOSED DOOR
HOLES 1 INCH HIGH.
WHAT DO I MEAN?
YOU'LL KNOW IT
IF YOU SEE IT.
WHAT WAS THAT???
CAREFUL. I'VE HEARD
THAT HOTEL HAS A
DOG PROBLEM.
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT PETS.
THE PROBLEM IS...
DOG.
NOT ALL DOGS.
JUST THAT ONE.
EVERYTHING.
THE FLOWER IS MY
FRIEND!
OH MY GOD!!
HE'S NOT IMAGINARY!
HE HAS A NAME!
FL...
FLOWERY?
OK, I DID!!
BUT HE'S REAL!!
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
HOTEL ROOM!?
... WHY?
MY GARAGE IS
ALWAYS OPEN TO
YOU!!
THE PRICE IS
RIGHT!!
PARTY "GAMES"?
LIKE THE SIX-
LEGGED RACE?
H-HEY!!!
NO PILLOWS FROM
THE COUCH!
HEY!!!
NO ENTIRE COUCH!!
HEY, YOU DIDN'T
HIT ME WITH MY
ENTIRE COUCH.
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
LINGUINE?
LINGUINE.
THE FLAT PASTA.
IT CAN ALSO BE
USED TO TIE UP
PRESENTS.
THE FLATNESS
MAKES A NICE
RIBBON.
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
IS ELEVATOR
REALLY SPELLED
THAT WAY?
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
RAVIOLI?
RAVIOLI...
THE DUMPLING-TYPE
PASTA.
THE TREASURE CHEST
OF THE CULINARY
WORLD.
YOU CAN PUT GEMS
OR GOLD INSIDE.
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R1.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
I GUESS THAT
MAKES SENSE!
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R2.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
RIGATONI?
THE TUBE-SHAPED
PASTA.
IN A PINCH, IT
CAN BE USED AS
A STRAW.
IF YOU NEED TO
DRINK A CUP OF
SAUCE.
WAIT, UNDYNE.
IF THE R STANDS
FOR RED...
WHAT COLOR DOES
THE L STAND FOR?
OH! OF COURSE!
WAIT.
ISN'T THAT TWO
WORDS?
THREE DOESN'T
FIX THE ISSUE!
AREN'T YOU WORKING
IN THE VERY NEXT
ROOM!?
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L2.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
LASAGNA?
I HOPE NOT.
I DON'T MAKE
LASAGNA ANYMORE.
THAT GLUTTONOUS
DOG ALWAYS EATS
IT FIRST!
FIRST MY BONES,
AND NOW THIS...
THEN IT RETREATS
INTO A SHALLOW
BLUE BOX.
COVERS ITSELF
WITH A BLANKET,
AND SLEEPS...
REALLY!?
I HATE LIMES.
WELL, ONE TIME I
WAS GIVING MYSELF
THE SPA TREATMENT.
I PUT THE LIME
SLICES IN MY
EYES, LIKE ON TV.
BUT IT STINGS!!
HOW DO THEY DO
IT!?
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE
REJUVENATING.
BUT IT WASN'T
WORKING!
SO I JUST STUCK
MORE LIMES INTO
MY EYES.
I JUST WANT TO
HAVE HANDSOME,
BISHONEN EYES.
LIKE METTATON...
SIGH...
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS L3.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
L STAND FOR?
LUMACONI?
THAT'S THE SNAIL-
SHAPED PASTA!
SANS BOUGHT SOME
RECENTLY.
HE'LL PROBABLY
FILL THEM WITH
HOTDOGS AND SLIME.
HEY!!
MAYBE HE'LL SHARE
SOME WITH YOU!
MAYBE WE NEED TO
THINK MORE
ABSTRACTLY.
MAYBE THE L
STANDS FOR...
LOVE.
BUT UNDYNE, DON'T
YOU TURN PEOPLE'S
HEARTS GREEN?
WELL, IT WOULD BE
AN AFFECTIONATE
NAUSEA.
IT'S DECIDED!!
L STANDS FOR!!
A HEART THAT
UNDYNE HAS MADE
NAUSEOUS?
THE ELEVATOR
SAYS R3.
BUT WHAT DOES THE
R STAND FOR?
ROTINI?
THE SCREW-SHAPED
PASTA.
I USED IT TO HOLD
MY SENTRY STATION
TOGETHER.
MY WHOLE STATION
IS MADE OUT OF
CARDBOARDHYDRATES!
WAIT.
WHAT IF R AND L.
STAND FOR RIGHT
AND LEFT???
BUT IF YOU FACE
THE OTHER WAY...
HOW CAN YOU KNOW
THEY ARE REALLY
STILL WRONG?
PAPYRUS?
WHO IS THAT?
THIS IS...
COOLSKELETON95.
SORRY. CAN'T TALK.
I'M BUSY BEING
POPULAR ON-LINE.
NYEH HEH HEH!
ONLY KIDDING!
YOU HAVE BEEN HAD!
IT WAS PAPYRUS
PLAYING A SIMPLE
GENTLEMAN'S RUSE!
WINK!
YOU CAN SEE
ME WINKING,
RIGHT.
PAPYRUS?
EXCUSE ME?
I AM THE VERY
COOL ONLINE GUY,
COOLSKELETON95.
(UNDYNE!!!)
(SHHH!!!)
(YOU'RE GOING TO
REVEAL MY SECRET
ONLINE PERSONA!)
WHAT!?
REALLY!?
OH NO!!!
STRONGFISH!!
PLEASE BRING BACK
MY FRIEND UNDYNE!
AN APRON LYING
IN HOTLAND?
THAT MAKES SENSE.
COOKING IS
DEFINITELY
FIRE-ELEMENTAL.
UNLESS YOU COOK
A POPSICLE.
UNLESS YOU COOK
A POPSICLE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU
CALLED IT LAST
TIME WE, UH...
WOW! I SAW IT!
THE MULTICOLOR
TILE PUZZLE!
YOU DID IT!!
MY DIRECTIONS
HELPED YOU!!
I'M A GOOD
EXPLAINER!
NYEH HEH HEH!
SEEMS LIKE YOU
WEREN'T ABLE TO
COMPLETE IT.
YOU'VE GOT TO
BE PREPARED NEXT
TIME!
I'LL HAVE TO
EXPLAIN IT ALL
AGAIN!
YOU SEE, RED
TILES ARE
IMPASSIBLE.
PINK TILES
DON'T DO
ANYTHING.
GREEN TILES
ARE...
PLAID TILES
ARE...
HEADING INTO
THE CORE...?
HMMM.
YOU MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO
CALL PAST THERE.
I KNOW!
IT SOUNDS AWFUL!
HOW WILL YOU
GET BY WITHOUT
ME?
WELL, I HAVE
CONFIDENCE YOU
WILL FIND A WAY!
I WILL TALK TO
YOU AGAIN, SO
DO NOT WORRY!
GOOD LUCK OUT
THERE!
QUIT IT!
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY GOODBYE!
OH NO!
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WITHOUT US...?
YEAH! YOU CAN'T
GET RID OF US!
A POSTER FOR
METTATON'S SHOW?
THAT'S NEATO.
I WANT A POSTER
FOR MY PUZZLES!
AND MAYBE A FEW
OPENING BANDS.
THEY COULD PLAY
MY THEME SONG!
I JUST NEED TO
GET A THEME SONG.
A REAL EVENT!
WE COULD HAVE A
LIVE BAND!
AND FIREWORKS!
WON'T YOU JUST
EAT BBQ INSTEAD
OF FIGHTING?
AND BONES AS
KABONE SKEWERS!
LIKE A KABOB BUT
WITH ONLY BONES.
DO SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FEET?
WAIT.
SPIDERS DON'T HAVE
FEET.
DO SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FINGERS?
JUST CURIOUS.
HEY, UNDYNE.
DO SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FEET?
DUCKS CAN SPIN
WEBS!?
BREAD HAS GUTS?
WOW!!
YOU'RE REALLY
SMART, UNDYNE!
OF COURSE!
EVERYONE KNOWS
SPIDERS HAVE
WEBBED FEET.
I'VE HEARD THERE
ARE TWO GROUPS
OF SPIDERS.
ONE IN HOTLAND,
AND ONE IN THE
RUINS.
SINCE THE SPIDERS
CAN'T CROSS THE
COLD OF SNOWDIN.
THEY NEED SOME
KIND OF TRANSPORT.
LIKE A TANDEM
MOTORCYCLE WITH
EIGHT WHEELS.
OR A UNICYCLE
WITH EIGHT
WHEELS!
I WONDER IF ANY
OF MY ONLINE
FANS ARE SPIDERS.
SANS!
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT SOMETHING.
FANGS FOR VISITING
MY WEB-SITE.
THAT'S WHAT SPIDERS
LIKE TO POST.
HMMM...
A MYSTERIOUS
SCIENCE HOUSE.
LAB?
LABRADOR... Y?
DOES THAT MEAN
THERE ARE DOGS
INSIDE?
STRANGE DOG'S
HOUSE...
ANIME?
ISN'T THAT A KIND
OF CARTOON FOR
SMALL CHILDREN?
IS (THE SOUND A
BABY MAKES) AN
EMOTION?
WAIT...
UNDYNE, DO YOU
LIKE ANIME?
UH OH!!!
I MEAN, I'VE
NEVER SEEN ANY.
MAYBE I ACTUALLY
DO LIKE ANIME!
MAYBE I'M A BABY
WHO LOVES CARTOONS
FOR CHILDREN!
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO
SAY.
SANS!!!
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO???
WHAT!?
NOBODY!?
CAN I TALK TO
THEM TOO???
WAIT A SECOND...
I RECOGNIZE THIS
NUMBER!!!
ATTENTION, HUMAN!
I, THE GREAT
PAPYRUS...
AM NOW CAPTAIN OF
THE ROYAL GUARD!
IT'S EVERYTHING I'VE
EVER DREAMED OF...
EXCEPT, INSTEAD
OF FIGHTING, WE
JUST WATER FLOWERS.
SO THAT'S EVER-
SO-SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT.
AND, WE'RE HELPING
DR. ALPHYS
WITH HER RESEARCH!
SHE'S GONNA FIND A
WAY TO GET US OUT
OF HERE.
UNDYNE IS HELPING
HER TOO!
THOUGH, TO BE
HONEST, HER METHOD
OF HELPING...
SEEMS KIND OF...
EXPLOSION-INDUCING.
BUT I THINK ALPHYS
LIKES HAVING HER
AROUND.
UH OH!!!
HEY!!! HUMAN!!!
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M DOING FINE!!!
WELL, BESIDES ONE
THING...
THE QUEEN
DISBANDED THE
ROYAL GUARD.
SINCE WE DON'T
HAVE TO FIGHT
HUMANS ANYMORE.
WOW!!!
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO
WITH MY LIFE.
BUT, THAT'S
OKAY!
BECAUSE I'M
STILL WORKING
HARD!
EVEN IF IT'S
ON NOTHING AT
ALL!
SO DON'T FEEL
BAD!
PAPYRUS IS FINE!
UNDYNE IS THE
ONE THAT'S GOT
IT BAD!
SHE LOST HER
JOB...
THEN SHE LOST
HER HOUSE...
IT WAS SAD...
BUT WE'RE TAKING
CARE OF HER!
SHE LIVES ON
OUR COUCH NOW.
IT'S LIKE A
SLEEPOVER EVERY
NIGHT!
A SLEEPOVER
THERE'S NO
ESCAPE FROM.
OH, WE GAVE HER
A JOB, TOO.
SANS HIRED HER AT
HIS ILLEGAL HOT
DOG STAND.
SHE HATES WORKING
THERE!
BUT SHE MAKES
A MEAN HOT DOG.
OH YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT THIS,
BUT...
SHE, UM, REALLY
HATES YOU NOW.
EVEN MORE THAN
SHE EVER HAS.
IT'S BECAUSE SHE
MADE FRIENDS WITH
YOU, THEN...
SHE SAID YOU
KILLED SOMEONE?
I KNOW, THAT
SOUNDS RIDICULOUS
DOESN'T IT?
BUT SHE FEELS SO
HURT AND BETRAYED.
AND ANGRY AT
HERSELF, TOO.
SHE SAYS...
SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY...
SHE EVER LET
HERSELF BECOME
FRIENDS WITH YOU.
THAT SHE KNEW
WHAT HUMANS WERE
LIKE...
AND YET SHE
STILL FAILED TO
RESIST.
MORE PEOPLE GOT
HURT BECAUSE OF
HER MISTAKE.
I REALLY CAN'T
UNDERSTATE.
HOW MUCH SHE
HATES YOU.
IT PAINS ME TO
SAY THIS, BUT...
YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY NEVER
COME BACK HERE.
IF YOU DO, UNDYNE
WILL DEFINITELY
DESTROY YOU.
NOT EVEN THE QUEEN
CAN STOP HER.
SO, UH...
GOODBYE FOREVER.
I'LL MISS YOU,
MY FRIEND.
AND YOU MADE
ASGORE DISAPPEAR?
AND MADE ALPHYS
DISAPPEAR, TOO.
SHE'S NOT VERY
HAPPY.
SHE SAYS THINGS
LIKE...
I COULDN'T PROTECT
HER...
IT'S HARD TO GET
HER TO DO ANYTHING
NOW.
I EVEN SUGGESTED
WE TRY TO GET
REVENGE ON YOU.
YOU KNOW, SO I
COULD SEE YOU
AGAIN.
BUT SHE JUST
LOOKED AT ME AND
SAID...
REVENGE WON'T BRING
ANYBODY BACK.
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU DID,
BUT...
CAN YOU PLEASE
BRING BACK HER
FRIENDS?
IF YOU MADE THEM
DISAPPEAR?
PLEASE...
UNDYNE'S NOT
DOING VERY WELL.
BYE.
SHE STILL BLAMES
YOU...
FOR THE
DISAPPEARANCE
OF ASGORE.
SHE TALKS TO ME
A LOT...
ABOUT GETTING
REVENGE ON YOU.
SHE HAS A
LUDICROUS PLAN...
TO CROSS THE
BARRIER AND
BEAT YOU UP.
TO BE HONEST,
I THINK IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT I'D LIKE TO
BELIEVE IT'S
NOT!!!
CAUSE I WANT TO
GO WITH HER!
THEN I'D GET TO
SEE YOU AGAIN!
EVEN IF I'D HAVE
TO FIGHT YOU.
WELL, KEEP YOUR
FINGERS CROSSED!
AND KEEP IN
TOUCH...
IT'LL MAKE OUR
PLANS EASIER.
BYE!
AND ALPHYS'
DISAPPEARANCE, TOO.
SHE'S NOT VERY
HAPPY.
SHE SAYS THINGS
LIKE...
BUT SHE JUST
LOOKED AT ME AND
SAID...
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU DID,
BUT...
PLEASE DON'T NOOGIE
THE PHONE.
ME.
BUT HE'S EXTREMELY
GOOD.
PLEASE DON'T NOOGIE
THE SKELETON.
BUT IF SHE KNEW
WHO WE WERE
TALKING TO...
WE HAVE THE
MERCY TO SPARE
YOU FROM HER!!
BYE BYE FOR NOW!
IF SHE KNEW WHO
WE WERE TALKING
TO...
YEAH!!!
I LOVE STANDING IN
FOR THE QUEEN!!!
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
FOR WHEN A HUMAN
COMES.
I'M GOING TO BE
A GREAT MOM!!!
BY THE WAY,
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?
OH, COOL.
TELL THEM I SAY
HI!!!
HEY, SANS, WHO ARE
YOU TALKING TO?
OH, COOL.
WAIT, DID YOU
SAY THE HUMAN!?
CAN I TALK TO
THEM???
HEY!!!
UNDYNE'S THE
EMPRESS NOW!!
IT'S AMAZING!!!
AND SHE APPOINTED
ME TO BE...
THE MOST IMPORTANT
ROYAL POSITION!!!
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S LITERALLY
THE TITLE.
WHAT DO I DO?
SHE TOLD ME TO,
UM...
STAND AROUND AND
LOOK CUTE.
WELL!!!
THAT'S THE PERFECT
JOB FOR ME!!!
I DO THAT ALL THE
TIME, WITHOUT
TRYING!!
FINALLY!!
I'M IMPORTANT.
AND IT'S ALL
THANKS TO YOU,
AND THE HORRIBLE
THINGS YOU DID.
THANK YOU, HUMAN!
COME BACK AND
VISIT SOMETIME!!
WAIT...
UNDYNE WOULD
PROBABLY KILL YOU.
BUT...
YOU'D GET TO
SEE ME.
SO YOU GOTTA
RISK IT!!!
YOU GOTTA!!!
SEE YOU SOON.
HEY!!!
IT'S ME, PAPYRUS!!
IMAGINE ME WEARING
COOL GLASSES, AND
A SUIT.
AND IMAGINE SANS
WEARING SUNGLASSES
BEING A BOUNCER.
THAT'S OUR LIFE...
IT'S SO COOL!!!
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
WAY BETTER SINCE
YOU CAME HERE!!!
WELL, MINUS THE
FACT THAT
EVERYTHING SUCKS...
FOR ANYONE THAT
DOESNT WORSHIP
METTATON.
AND MINUS THE FACT
THAT MY FRIEND
UNDYNE IS MISSING.
WHO KNOWS WHERE
SHE WENT.
SHE NEVER LIKED
METTATON'S SHOW.
PEOPLE WHO DON'T
TEND TO KIND OF...
DISAPPEAR.
I MISS HER A
LOT SOMETIMES.
IF YOU SEE HER,
CAN YOU TELL HER
I SAID HI?
THANKS!
SEE YOU LATER!
HELLO!!!
HUMAN!!!
IT'S STRANGE.
ASGORE, ALPHYS,
METTATON, AND
UNDYNE WENT AWAY.
SANS SAYS THEY
WENT ON VACATION.
I HOPE THEY'RE
HAVING FUN!!!
OH YEAH.
I'M THE RULER OF
THE UNDERGROUND
NOW!!!
EVERYTHING IS
IMPROVING A LOT
HERE.
PRODUCTIVITY IS UP!
BECAUSE I TELL
EVERYONE TO KEEP
WORKING.
AND, NO ONE GOES
HUNGRY!!!
BECAUSE I COOK
EVERYONE
SPAGHETTI.
MEANWHILE, MY
BROTHER HANDLES
THE PAPERWORK.
STRANGELY...
HE SEEMS TO BE
WORKING HARD?
THIS SOUNDS MESSED
UP... BUT...
I'M PROUD...
OF HIM???
OH NO!!!!
AS FOR OUR HUMAN
POLICY...
WE'VE DECIDED, UM.
SANS, WHAT WAS IT?
RIGHT!
SO IT'S CASE-BY-
CASE!
IF THEY'RE EVIL...
WE GIVE THEM
PUZZLES!
IF THEY'RE GOOD...
WE ALSO GIVE
THEM PUZZLES!
THAT SEEMS TO BE
THE BEST WAY!
IS SANS GONE?
YOU KNOW...
DON'T TELL MY
BROTHER, BUT...
DESPITE THE
IMPROVEMENTS
WE'VE MADE...
SOMETIMES THIS JOB
IS KIND OF HARD.
SINCE THE KING
WENT AWAY...
LOTS OF PEOPLE
JUST WANT TO
GIVE UP.
SOMETIMES, EVEN MY
BEST
ENCOURAGEMENT...
DOESN'T WORK.
AND, AND, I MISS
UNDYNE, TOO.
SHE NEVER ANSWERS
MY PHONE CALLS...
SHE MUST BE
 HAVING A LOT OF
FUN ON VACATION.
I JUST WISH SHE'D
SEND A POSTCARD.
BUT HEY!!!
I WON'T GIVE UP!
I CAN'T GIVE UP!
I HAVE TO MAKE
EVERYONE GIVE UP
GIVING UP!
WE'LL GET OUT
OF HERE, SLOWLY!!!
THEN WE CAN ALL
HANG OUT AGAIN!!!
NYEH HEH HEH!!!
HOWDY!
IF IT ISN'T MY
GOOD FRIEND,
WHO TRUSTS ME.
THIS IS PAPYRUS.
YOUR ALSO
MUTUAL FRIEND.
ALPHYS AND I
FINISHED OUR
TRAINING EARLY.
VERY EARLY.
SO I SENT HER
HOME.
VERY HOME.
UH... NOW.
I FEEL STRONGLY
AND FOR NO
APPARENT REASON.
YOU SHOULD ALSO
GO... THERE.
TO HER.
LAB... HOUSE.
I HAVE ONLY
GOOD FEELINGS
ABOUT THIS.
GOODBYE.

Plaque
"The power to take their
  SOULs."
"This is the power that
  the humans feared."
"The War of Humans and
  Monsters."
The northern room hides a
  great treasure.
Hurt, beaten, and fearful for
  our lives, we surrendered
  to the humans.
Seven of their greatest
  magicians sealed us underground
  with a magic spell.
Anything can enter through the
  seal, but only beings with a
  powerful SOUL can leave.
However...
There is a prophecy.
The Angel...
The One Who Has Seen The
  Surface...
They will return.
And the underground will go
  empty.
The humans, afraid of our
  power, declared war on us.
They attacked suddenly, and
  without mercy.
Without candles or magic to
  guide them Home, the monsters
  used crystals to navigate.
Why did the humans attack?
Indeed, it seemed that they
  had nothing to fear.
Humans are unbelievably strong.
It would take the SOUL of
  nearly every monster...
... just to equal the power
  of a single human SOUL.
This power has no counter.
Indeed, a human cannot
  take a monster's SOUL.
When a monster dies, its
  SOUL disappears.
And an incredible power
  would be needed to take the
  SOUL of a living monster.
There is only one way to
  reverse this spell.
If a huge power, equivalent
  to seven human SOULs, attacks
  the barrier...
It will be destroyed.
In the end, it could
  hardly be called a war.
United, the humans were too
  powerful, and us monsters,
  too weak.
Not a single SOUL was taken,
  and countless monsters were
  turned to dust...
When four Bridge Seeds align
  in the water, they will
  sprout.
If an error is made, the Bell
  Blossom can call Bridge Seeds
  back to where they started.
WISHING ROOM
But humans have one weakness.
Ironically, it is the strength
  of their SOUL.
Its power allows it to persist
  outside the human body, even
  after death.
There is only one exception.
The SOUL of a special species
  of monster called a
  "Boss Monster."
A Boss Monster's SOUL is
  strong enough to persist
  after death...
If only for a few moments.
A human could absorb this
  SOUL.
But this has never happened.
And now it never will.
But this cursed place has
  no entrances or exits.
There is no way a human
  could come here.
We will remain trapped
  down here forever.
If a monster defeats a human,
  they can take its SOUL.
A monster with a human SOUL...
A horrible beast with
  unfathomable power.
A haunting song echoes
  down the corridor...
Won't you play along?
Only the first 8 are fine.
(It's an illustration of a
  strange creature...)
(There's something very
  unsettling about this drawing.)
Politics Bear
This town doesn't have a
  mayor.
But if there's ever a problem,
  a skeleton will tell a fish
  lady about it.
Thaaaaaat's politics!
Politics.
What if I ran for mayor...?
I don't think I would do
  a good job, and I hate
  responsibility...
But I love politics.
So I might be a perfect
  match.
I heard Dr. Alphys told
  the king and queen the
  awful things she'd done.
The king felt so bad
  that he didn't know.
He gave her a big hug.
Then the queen fired her.
Now we don't have a Royal
  Scientist anymore...
Thaaaaat's politics!
Too bad there are no
  politics on the surface.
Hmmm, usually that skeleton
  goes to meet with Undyne
  about now.
Where is he...?
I can feel our political
  system crumbling apart...
Punk Hamster
The capital's getting pretty
  crowded, so I've heard they're
  going to start moving here.
Hmmm...
I don't want to see the
  erasure of our local culture.
But I definitely want to see
  some city slickers slip onto
  their butts!
Yeah, bring 'em on!
What will happen to
  Grillby's if everyone
  moves in...?
We're gonna have to have
  chairs to the ceiling.
Hey! People won't have to
  move in from the city
  anymore!
Seems like we won't have
  to lose our local culture.
... except we're all moving
  out of here, huh.
Oh well. Guess it can't be
  all punk-peaches and punk-
  cream.
... who knows.
Maybe we'll have room.
Pyrope
Hot!!!
Error.
Burn,
baby,
BURN!
Hot

I've done up a trouble.
I set the lava on fire.
No one will EVER know.
It's the perfect crime...
Haha, ha ha ha.
If we leave, no one will
  REALLY ever know!!
This crime just gets perfecter
  and perfecter.
The lava's so spicey now.
Haha, ha ha ha.
Ya wanna "hang" out?
Haha, ha ha ha.
Sorry, I'm all TIED UP!!!
Psyche! Owned!
No one wants to be MY
  friend!!!
Haha, ha ha ha.
Wonder if any humans would
  wanna be my friend.
PSYYYYCHE!
That'd NEVER happen!
I'm too spicey to have
  any friends.

She's...
Like, Undyne!
We'll avenge you!
Hey! You!
Stop!
We've, like, received an
  anonymous tip about a human
  wearing a striped shirt.
They told us they were
  wandering around Hotland
  right now...
I know, sounds scary, huh?
Well, just stay chill.
We'll bring you someplace
  safe, OK?
... Huh?
What is it, bro?
The shirt they're wearing?
... like, what about it?
Bro...
Are you thinkin...
What I'm thinkin?
Bummer.
This is, like...
Mega embarrassing.
We, like, actually
  totally have to kill
  you and stuff.
Sorry... UNDYNE, like, told
  us there was totally a
  human in the area.
So, like, us Royal Guards are
  blocking off the elevators
  for now.
Ngah! Even if the elevators
  aren't working anyway, we'll
  do our best, Ms. UNDYNE!
Like, NO WAY you're getting
  by us.
But, between you and me...
I think you could go through
  that creepy lab over there.
Between you, me, and my
  bro here, I mean.
I tell him ALL my secrets.
Hey!
No loitering!
Like, just kidding.
I don't care.
Like, loiter your heart out.
Oh, hey.
We're, like, taking a rain
  check on that killing-you
  thing.
Like, don't tell Undyne
  about this, OK?
You didn't tell her, did
  you...?
Undyne told us that the
  Royal Guard is being disbanded.
Like, bummer...
Guess we'll have to get
  used to Love and Peace.
You can
do it!

Yes.
It is.
Go

Laugh at

Our friendship

That old drama?
Forget about it.
To tell you the
truth, I requested
to be partners
with you.
I wanted to become
friends with you

But I didn't know
how to breach the

03, I'm sorry.
I thought you hated
me, after what
happened...
We did some pretty
nasty things to
each other, because
of...

After this...
Do you want to get
some ice-cream?
You know
it!
Rabbit Girl
Isn't my little Cinnamon
  just the cutest?
Bun-buns are so adorable...
Tee hee!
Bun-bun-bun-bun-bun...
Huh? Yes, I'm taking
  my bunny for a walk.
It's just a very slow one.
That kid over there told
  me that it's weird that
  I have a pet bunny.
First, there'd be nothing
  weird about it.
It's cute!
Second...
What?
It's normal to walk your
  younger brother on a
  leash, right?
Ah, it's so peaceful
  and quiet...
Usually one of those dogs
  chases my little Cinnamon
  around.
Usually one of those
  skeletons chases my little
  Cinnamon around.
Rabbit Kid
We're about to visit Snowdin
  for the first time.
You just came from there,
  right?
How is it...?
You should go back to
  Snowdin.
That lady over there...
Something about her disturbs
  me.
I think I've figured it out.
... no, nevermind.
That lady over there's
  been going for a walk
  for a while now.
... but she hasn't moved
  an inch from where she's
  standing.
W-well, I haven't either,
  but I don't want her to
  notice me over here...
Is anyone else weirded out
  by those giant shambling
  amalgamates, or...?
......
That lady over there
  seems happy today.
Don't know why, but it's
  sending shivers down my
  spine...
Ragel
Mushroom dance
Mushroom dance
Whatever could it mean
It symbolizes my inner
  pain.
It symbolizes my inner
  torment, trapped here
  by my hyphae.
My struggle to pull away.
My struggle to escape.
But alas, to no avail.
If only I could see the
  world above.
But even if the barrier
  was open, how would I
  leave...?
It means you've lived a
  life of sin.
It means...
Don't talk to me.
It symbolizes my unbridled
  happiness.
The government told me
  they are willing to
  transplant me outside!
Why didn't you smile at my
  dance? It almost feels
  a little rude...
Reaper Bird
Don't
pick on
me.

Those dogs are part of
  the ROYAL GUARD, the elite
  military group led by UNDYNE.
She's rude, loud, and beats up
  everybody who gets in her
  way...
It's no wonder all the kids
  want to be like her when
  they grow up!
I want to be like UNDYNE
  when I grow up, too!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Sans is a sentry.
But don't let his title make
  you think he does anything.
Everyone knows he sits
  around in the forest
  reading car magazines.
Ehhhhhhhhnnnnn...
I wish I had something else
  to do.
Those dogs are part of
  the ROYAL GUARD, the...
Huh?
Where are they?
Something feels really off.
Wow, a brand new world...
I might not get to
  translate for Grillby
  anymore...
... which is fine, since I
  was actually just making
  up what he was saying.
Grillby is getting nervous.
Sans is his best customer,
  and he hasn't shown up
  at all today...
Something feels really bad.
Our lives are going nowhere,
  aren't they...?
I think I need another
  espresso...
Grillbz said that he'd offer
  you a glass of water, but he
  doesn't touch the stuff.
Grillbz said that your
  food is probably cold

WHOA there, pardner!
Who said you could push
  me around?
HMM?
So you're ASKIN' me to
  move over?
Okay, just for you,
  pumpkin.
HMM?
You want me to move some
  more?
Alrighty, how's this?
HMM?
That was the wrong direction?
Okay, think I got it.
Was that helpful?
HMM?
You wanted me to STAY there?
You're giving me a real
  workout.
Aren't things easier when
  you just ask?
The exit's open?
Guess I better roll out...
Hey, y'mind giving me a
  push, pumpkin?
Sad Dragon
Yeah, I'm not gonna be home
  tonight... um...
I think there's some cold
  pizza in my treasure horde
  you can heat up...
Ummm, are you guys on your
  way out?
Guess I'll catch up with you
  later...
In fact, I don't feel like
  I'll be home tomorrow,
  either, at this rate...
Sans
whoops.
i knew i should have
  used today's crossword
  instead.
what? really, dude?
that easy-peasy word
  scramble?
that's for baby bones.
i've been thinking
  about selling treats
  too.
  
you're right.
i should charge way
  more than than that.
that's still too low.
i have to pay for
  the raw materials
  somehow.
what?
you don't have the
  money?
hey, that's okay.
i don't have any snow.
wow, that's a lot
  of cash.
that's why i'm sorry
  to say...
i can't sell you
  this fried snow.
it's got too much
  sentimental value.
don't you know a
  good deal when you
  hear one?
i'm thinking about
  getting into the
  telescope business.
it's normally 50000G
  to use this premium
  telescope...
but...
since i know you,
  you can use it for free.
howzabout it?
huh?
you aren't satisfied?
don't worry.
i'll give you a
  full refund.
well, come back
  whenever you want.
what?
haven't you seen a guy
  with two jobs before?
fortunately, two jobs
  means twice as many
  legally-required breaks.
...
hey, looks like you're
  really turning yourself
  around.
how about i treat you
  to lunch at grillby's?
... when everyone you
  scared away comes
  back, i mean.
well, if you insist...
i'll pry myself away
  from my work...
OK. have fun.
whoops, watch where
  you sit down.
sometimes weirdos put
  whoopee cushions on
  the seats.
anyway, let's order.
ok, coming right up.
hey, that sounds
  pretty good.
grillby, we'll have
  a double order of
  fries.
grillby, we'll have
  a double order of
  burg.
so, what do you
  think...
of course he's cool.
you'd be cool too
  if you wore that
  outfit every day.
he'd only take that
  thing off if he
  absolutely had to.
oh well.
at least he washes
  it.
and by that i mean
  he wears it in
  the shower.
hey, pal.
sarcasm isn't funny,
  okay?
my brother's a real
  star.
he's the person who
  pushed me to get
  this sentry job.
maybe it's a little
  strange, but
  sometimes...
... it's nice to have
  someone call you out
  on being lazy.
even though nothing
  could be further
  from the truth.
here comes the grub.
bone appetit.
more for me.
so you know all
  about it.
i'll tell you, then.
the echo flower.
they're all over the
  marsh.
say something to them,
  and they'll repeat it
  over and over...
what about it?
well, papyrus told
  me something interesting
  the other day.
sometimes, when no
  one else is around...
a flower appears and
  whispers things to
  him.
flattery...
advice...
encouragement...
... predictions.
weird, huh?
someone must be using
  an echo flower to
  play a trick on him.
keep an eye out, ok?
thanks.
oh, by the way...
i'm flat broke.
can you foot the
  bill?
hey buddy, what's up?
wanna buy a hot dog?
here.
have fun.
here's another hot
  dog.
it's on the house.
well, no.
it's on you.
sorry, thirty is
  the limit on
  head-dogs.
i'll be 'frank' with
  you.
as much as i like
  putting hot dogs
  on your head...
thirty is just
  an excessive number.
twenty-nine, now
  that's fine, but
  thirty...
does it look like
  my arms can reach
  that high?
thanks, kid.
here's your hot dog.
thanks, kid.
here's your 'dog.
yeah. 'dog.
apostrophe-dog.
it's short for hot-dog.
another h'dog?
here you go...
whoops, i'm actually
  out of hot dogs.
here, you can have
  a hot cat instead.
another dog, coming
  right up...
... you really like
  hot animals, don't
  you?
hey, i'm not judging.
i'd be out of a job
  without folks like you.
cool.
here's that ''dog.
apostrophe-apostrophe
  dog.
it's short for
  apostrophe-dog.
which is, in turn,
  short for...
another one?
okay.
careful.
if you eat
  too many hot dogs...
you'll probably get
  huge like me.
huge as in super-
  popular, i mean.
i'm practically
  a hot-dog tycoon now.
whoops, you don't have
  enough cash.
you should get a job.
i've heard being a
  sentry pays well.
you're holding too much.
... guess i'll just put
  it on your head.
yeah, you've gotta
  save your money for
  college and spiders.
hey.
i heard you're going
  to the core.
great, thanks for
  treating me.
well, have fun in
  there.
guess i have to
  go in the trash
  too.
we call that
  "the sun," my friend.
though...
one thing about you
  always struck me
  as kinda odd.
now, i understand
  acting in self-defense.
you were thrown into
  those situations
  against your will.
but...
sometimes...
you act like you
  know what's gonna
  happen.
like you've already
  experienced it all
  before.
this is an odd thing
  to say, but...
if you have some sort
  of special power...
isn't it your
  responsibility to do
  the right thing?
ah.
i see.
...
heh.
well, that's your
  viewpoint.
i won't judge you
  for it.
nope.
that's called snow.
me too.
   
huh.
always wondered why
people never use
their strongest
attack first.
anyway, as i was
saying, it's a
nice day out.
why not relax and
take a load off?
here we go.
huff... puff...
all right.
that's it.
it's time for my 
special attack.
are you ready?
here goes nothing.
yep.
that's right.
it's literally
nothing.
and it's not gonna
be anything,
either.
heh heh heh...
ya get it?
i know i can't
beat you.
one of your turns...
you're just gonna
kill me.
so, uh.
i've decided...
it's not gonna BE
your turn.
ever.
i'm just gonna
keep having MY
turn until you
give up.
even if it means
we have to stand
here until the
end of time.
capiche?
you'll get bored
here.
if you haven't
gotten bored
already, i mean.
and then, you'll
finally quit.
i know your type.
you're, uh, very
determined, aren't
you?
you'll never give
up, even if
there's, uh...
absolutely NO
benefit to
persevering
whatsoever.
if i can make
that clear.
no matter what,
you'll just keep
going.
not out of any
desire for good
or evil...
but just because
you think you
can.
and because you
"can"...
... you "have to."
but now, you've
reached the end.
there is nothing
left for you now.
so, uh, in my
personal opinion...
the most
"determined"
thing you can
do here?
is to, uh,
completely give
up.
and... (yawn)
do literally
anything else.
heh, didja
really think you
would be able to
so...
guess that's it,
huh?
just...
don't say i
didn't warn you.
welp.
i'm going to
grillby's.
papyrus, do you
want anything?
what?
you think i'm just
gonna stand there
and take it?
our reports showed
a massive anomaly
in the timespace
continuum.
timelines jumping
left and right,
stopping and
starting...
until suddenly,
everything ends.
heh heh heh...
that's your fault,
isn't it?
you can't understand
how this feels.
knowing that one
day, without any
warning...
it's all going to
be reset.
look.
i gave up trying
to go back a long
time ago.
and getting to the
surface doesn't
really appeal
anymore, either.
cause even if we
do...
we'll just end up
right back here,
without any memory
of it, right?
to be blunt...
it makes it kind
of hard to give
it my all.
... or is that just
a poor excuse for
being lazy...?
hell if i know.
all i know is...
seeing what comes
next...
i can't afford not
to care anymore.
ugh...
that being said...
you, uh, really
like swinging that
thing around,
huh?
listen.
i know you didn't
answer me before,
but...
somewhere in
there.
i can feel it.
there's a glimmer
of a good person
inside of you.
the memory of
someone who once
wanted to do the
right thing.
someone who, in
another time,
might have even
been...
a friend?
c'mon, buddy.
do you remember
me?
please, if you're
listening...
let's forget all
this, ok?
just lay down
your weapon, and...
well, my job
will be a lot
easier.
friendship...
it's really great,
right?
let's quit fighting.
welp, it was
worth a shot.
guess you like
doing things the
hard way, huh?
woah, you look
REALLY pissed off...
heheheh...
did i getcha?
well, if you came
back anyway...
i guess that means
we never really
WERE friends, huh?
heh.
don't tell that
to the other
sans-es, ok?
sounds strange, but
before all this i
was secretly hoping
we could be friends.
i always thought the
anomaly was doing
this cause they
were unhappy.
and when they got
what they wanted,
they would stop
all this.
and maybe all they
needed was...
i dunno.
some good food,
some bad laughs,
some nice friends.
but that's
ridiculous,
right?
yeah, you're the
type of person
who won't EVER
be happy.
you'll keep
consuming timelines
over and over,
until...
well.
hey.
take it from me,
kid.
someday...
you gotta learn
when to QUIT.
and that day's
TODAY.
cause...
y'see..
all this fighting
is really tiring
me out.
and if you keep
pushing me...
then i'll be
forced to use my 
special attack.
yeah, my special
attack.
sound familiar?
well, get ready.
cause after the
next move, i'm
going to use it.
so, if you don't
wanna see it, now
would be a good
time to die.
well, here goes
nothing...
survive THIS, and
i'll show you my 
special attack!
you're sparing me?
finally.
buddy.
pal.
i know how hard
it must be...
to make that
choice.
to go back on
everything you've
worked up to.
i want you to
know...
i won't let it
go to waste.
...
c'mere, pal.
it's a beautiful
day outside.
birds are singing,
flowers are
blooming...
on days like these,
kids like you...
birds are singing,
ready?
Should
be
burning
in hell.
nah, i'm rootin for
ya, kid.                                 
just
give
up.
i did.
why
even
try?
you'll
never
see 'em
again.
  geeettttttt
  dunked on!!!
  if we're really
  friends...
  you won't come back.
hey there.
this is just a little test.
    
no. not today.
actually, hey...
hate to bother ya, but
  can you do me a favor?
i was thinking...
my brother's been
  kind of down lately...
he's never seen a human
  before. and seeing you
  might just make his day.
don't worry, he's not
  dangerous.
even if he tries to be.
thanks a million.
i'll be up ahead.
well, i'll be straight-
  forward with you.
my brother'd really
  like to see a human...
so, y'know, it'd
  really help me out...
if you kept pretending
  to be one.
don't you only have
  one outfit?
oh. right.
good idea.
say, why don't you
  look over there?
behold.
uhhhh...
actually, i think that's
  a rock.
uhhhh...
i think it looks
  familiar...
because it's a rock?
hey, what's that in
  front of the rock?
(yes)
well.
it's not a rock.
well, that went well.
don't sweat it, kid.
i'll keep an eyesocket
  out for ya.
... and you don't even
  bat an eye, huh?
i think that's called...
sleeping.
do you not know...
who you know?
i think the human
  has to hold the orb.
it's right there.
on the ground.
trust me.
there's no way they can
  get past this one.
trust me.
there's no way they'll
  skip this one.
i'm tellin' ya.
everyone likes word
  searches.
knew i should have
  put down junior jumble
  instead.
well, maybe they
  don't like japes.
what about undyne?
doesn't she hate
  puzzles?
that makes sense.
well?
what's the holdup?
that, uh, doesn't look
  very activated.
hmmm...
so this human thing
  was a bust, huh?
without traps and fire?
me?
right about something?
really?
heheh... the old whoopee
  cushion in the hand
  trick.
it's ALWAYS funny.
anyways,
  you're a human, right?
that's hilarious.
heh, the old whoopee
  cushion in the hand
  trick...
wait a sec...
have you heard it before
  or something?
you turned around before
  i said to...
... weird.
... whatever.
you're a human, right?
i'm sans.
sans the skeleton.
im actually supposed to
  be on watch for
  humans right now.
but... y'know...
i dont really care about
  capturing anybody.
now my brother,
  papyrus...
he's a human-hunting
  FANATIC.
hey, actually, I think
  that's him over there.
i have an idea.
go through this gate
  thingy.
yeah, go right through.
my bro made the bars
  too wide to stop anyone.
that's, uh.
your cue to laugh.
or, uh, to emote
  at all...?
(gee, lady, you really
  know how to pick
  'em, huh...?)
OK, that's fine.
everyone's got their
  own sense of humor.
Human.
Don't you know how
  to greet a new pal?
Turn around and shake
  my hand.
quick, behind that
  conveniently-shaped
  lamp.
sup, bro?
staring at this lamp.
it's really cool.
do you wanna look?
hmm...
maybe this lamp will
  help you.
hey, take it easy.
i've gotten a ton 
  of work done today.
a skele-ton.
come on.
you're smiling.
wow, sounds like
  you're really working
  yourself...
down to the bone.
ok, you can come out
  now.
uh, ok, i guess you
  don't have to.
yeah.
that worked out, huh?
you oughta get going.
he might come back.
and if he does...
... you'll have to
  sit through more of
  my hilarious jokes.
what's the holdup?
look, there's nothin
  to be afraid of.
it's just a dark cavern
  filled with skeletons
  and horrible monsters.
well?
... are you just gonna
  stare at me, or...?
hey, here's something
  important to remember.
my brother has a very
  special attack.
if you see a blue
  attack, don't move and
  it won't hurt you.
here's an easy way to
  keep it in mind.
imagine a stop sign.
when you see a stop
  sign, you stop, right?
stop signs are red.
so imagine a blue stop
  sign instead.
simple, right?
when fighting, think
  about blue stop signs.
remember...
blue stop signs.
hey, thanks...
my brother seems like
  he's having fun.
by the way, did you
  see that weird outfit
  he's wearing?
we made that a few
  weeks ago for a costume
  party.
he hasn't worn anything
  else since...
keeps calling it his
  "battle body."
man.
isn't my brother cool?
it would make my
  brother happy if you
  played along.
thanks for saying
  "junior jumble" just
  to appease my brother.
yesterday he got
  stumped trying to
  "solve" the horoscope.
papyrus...
... finds difficulty in
  interesting places.
guess you don't like
  word searches, huh?
me neither.
i'm more of a funny
  pages kind of guy.
i guess despite all
  that, you still like
  word searches, huh...?
that means you can't
  be all bad.
actually, that spaghetti
  from earlier...
it wasn't too bad for
  my brother.
since he started cooking
  lessons, he's been
  improving a lot.
i bet if he keeps it
  up, next year he'll even
  make something edible.
hey...
puzzles might be fun.
if you tried them.
good job on solving it
  so quickly.
you didn't even need
  my help.
which is great, 'cause
  i love doing absolutely
  nothing.
... you must be really
  good at puzzles,
  huh?
it's impossible for
  you to have seen
  this one before.
hey, why didn't you
  ask for help?
i was right here.
what's up?
you sure do like to
  exercise.
i don't know what my
  brother's going to do
  now.
if i were you, i would
  make sure i understand
  blue attacks.
here, i'll give you some
  advice about fighting
  my brother.
don't.
capiche?
hmmm...
guess we didn't need
  your help to have a
  good time after all.
say, i've been
  thinking.
seems like you're
  gonna fight my brother
  pretty soon.
here's some friendly
  advice.
if you keep going the
  way you are now...
you're gonna have a
  bad time.
dang, i wish i brought
  a parasol.
i'm getting a nasty burn
  from all this sun.
say...
are you following me?
are you lost?
grievous error
let's hang out again
  sometime.
hey, i really
  respect what you did
  back there.
over here.
i know a shortcut.
well, here we are.
so.
your journey's
  almost over, huh?
you must really
  wanna go home.
hey.
i know the feeling,
  buddo.
though...
maybe sometimes it's
  better to take what's
  given to you.
down here you've
  already got food,
  drink, friends...
is what you have
  to do...
really worth it?
ah, forget it.
i'm rootin' for
  ya, kid.
let me tell you
  a story.
so i'm a sentry in
  snowdin forest, right?
i sit out there
  and watch for humans.
it's kind of boring.
fortunately, deep in
  the forest...
there's this HUGE
  locked door.
and it's perfect
  for practicing
  knock knock jokes.
so one day, i'm
  knocking 'em out,
  like usual.
i knock on the
  door and say
  "knock knock."
and suddenly, from
  the other side...
i hear a woman's
  voice.
"who is there?" 
so, naturally, I
  respond:
"dishes."
"dishes who?"
"dishes a very
  bad joke."
then she just
  howls with laughter.
like it's the best
  joke she's heard
  in a hundred years.
so I keep 'em
  coming, and she keeps
  laughing.
she's the best
  audience i've ever
  had.
then, after a
  dozen of 'em,
  SHE knocks and says...
"Knock knock!"
i say "whos
  there?"
"old lady!"
"old lady who?"
"oh! I did not
  know you could
  yodel!"
wow.
needless to say,
  this woman was
  extremely good.
we kept telling
  each other jokes
  for hours.
eventually, i had
  to leave.
papyrus gets kind
  of cranky without
  his bedtime story.
but she told me
  to come by again,
  and so i did.
then i did again.
and again.
it's a thing now.
telling bad jokes
  through the door.
it rules.
one day, though, i
  noticed she wasn't
  laughing very much.
i asked her what
  was up.
then she told me
  something strange.
"if a human ever
  comes through this
  door..."
"... could you please,
  please promise
  something?"
"watch over them,
  and protect them,
  will you not?"
now, i hate making
  promises.
and this woman,
  i don't even know
  her name.
but...
someone who sincerely
  likes bad jokes...
has an integrity
  you can't say
  "no" to.
do you get what
  i'm saying?
that promise i made
  to her...
you know what would
  have happened if she
  hadn't said anything?
... buddy.
... You'd be dead
  where you stand.
hey, lighten up,
  bucko!
i'm just joking
  with you.
besides...
haven't i done a
  great job protecting
  you?
i mean, look at
  yourself.
you haven't died
  a single time.
that's right, isn't
  it?
well, chalk it
  up to my great
  skills.
hey, what's that
  look supposed to
  mean?
am i wrong...?
heh.
well, that's all.
take care of
  yourself, kid.
'cause someone really
  cares about you.
welp.
someone's gotta keep
  him from getting
  into trouble.
see you guys.
yeah.
you made papyrus cry
  like a baby.
what did you catch?
oh man, tori...
that's brutal.
well.
cause we're huge
  dorks.
then why are you
  smiling?
hey, frisk, what's
  with that weird
  expression?
oh boy.
hey, tori, do you
  have any other
  embarrassing stories?
oh hey, what's up,
  frisk?
we were just talking
  about you.
apparently you asked
  to call tori "mom" right
  after meeting her?
frisk...
i gotta tell ya.
that's, uh, not the
  best way to get
  to know someone.
frisk, tori was telling
  me how she made
  b'scotch pie for you.
sorry...
i don't have time
  to talk, frisk.
i'm supposed to be
  working right now.
i know, and it's
  taking all my
  concentration.
no matter how hard
  you try to get
  rid of him.
frisk, why don't you
  fly?
it's faster.
yeah, what do you...
whoops.
doesn't everybody?
So you finally made it.
The end of your journey
  is at hand.
In a few moments, you
  will meet the king.
Together...
You will determine the
  future of this world.
That's then.
Now.
You will be judged.
You will be judged for
  your every action.
You will be judged for
  every EXP you've earned.
What's EXP?
It's an acronym.
It stands for "execution
  points."
A way of quantifying the
  pain you have inflicted on
  others.
When you kill someone,
  your EXP increases.
When you have enough EXP,
  your LOVE increases.
LOVE, too, is an
  acronym.
It stands for "Level of
  Violence."
A way of measuring someone's
  capacity to hurt.
The more you kill, the
  easier it becomes to
  distance yourself.
The more you distance
  yourself, the less you
  will hurt.
The more easily you
  can bring yourself to
  hurt others.
So you finally made it...
Now, you understand.
It's time to begin your
  judgment.
Look inside yourself.
Have you really done the
  right thing?
And, considering what
  you've done...
What will you do now?
Take a moment to think
  about this.
... but you.
you never gained
  any LOVE.
'course, that doesn't
  mean you're completely
  innocent or naive.
just that you kept
  a certain tenderness
  in your heart.
no matter the struggles
  or hardships you
  faced...
you strived to do the
  right thing.
you refused to hurt
  anyone.
even when you ran
  away, you did it
  with a smile.
you never gained LOVE,
  but you gained love.
does that make sense?
maybe not.
...
now.
you're about to face
  the greatest challenge
  of your entire journey.
your actions here...
will determine the
  fate of the entire
  world.
if you refuse to
  fight...
asgore will take
  your soul and
  destroy humanity.
but if you kill
  asgore and go
  home...
monsters will remain
  trapped underground.
what will you do?
well, if i were you,
  i would have thrown
  in the towel by now.
but you didn't get
  this far by giving
  up, did you?
that's right.
you have something
  called "determination."
so as long as you
  hold on...
so as long as you
  do what's in your
  heart...
i believe you can do
  the right thing.
alright.
we're all counting
  on you, kid.
good luck.
truthfully, it doesn't
  really matter what you
  said.
all that's important is
  that you were honest
  with yourself.
what happens now...
we leave up to you.
pepis
Then why'd you
  kill my
  brother?
You dirty brother
  killer.
huh?
you look bored.
i get the feeling
  you aren't gonna learn
  anything from this.
well, guess I gotta
  judge you then.
come on.
really?
lv2...
seems like you messed
  up the slightest amount.
welp.
that's pretty sad.
you probably weren't
  even aware of what you
  were doing...
and when you learned,
  it was too late.
nah, just kidding.
who gets to lv2 on
  accident?
get outta here.
lv3...
3's just an ok number,
  i guess.
i'll give you a C+.
you can do better,
  right?
hmmm...
over lv3, huh.
you killed some people
  on purpose, didn't you?
that's probably bad.
though, maybe some
  of it was in self-
  defense...
i don't know.
help me out here.
i wasn't watching.
anyways, don't do that.
hmmm...
over lv9, huh.
that's over halfway to
  lv20, the maximum.
but don't think that
  means you're still 50-
  percent good.
50-percent, 20-percent.
those are both still
  failing grades.
besides.
chances are...
i've already tried to
  steer you in the right
  direction.
so what can i say?
what can i say that
  will change the mind of
  a being like you...?
hmmm...
over lv14, huh.
well, hmmm...
judgment-wise...
you're a pretty bad
  person.
you wander around,
  looking for people...
killing them to take
  their money.
that's just plain
  messed up.
and what's worse, is
  that as bad as you
  are...
you aren't anywhere near
  as bad as you could
  be.
you pretty much suck
  at being evil.
honestly, it's super
  embarrassing.
but maybe you'd be
  better...
at not killing anyone?
crazy idea, huh?
let me know how that
  one goes.
... huh?
what's with that look
  in your eye?
did you go through and
  kill someone...
just to see what i'd
  say about it?
wow.
you're a pretty gross
  person, huh?
huh?
you STILL look bored.
okay then, consider
  our session over.
wait a second.
that look on your
  face while i was
  talking...
you've already heard
  my spiel, haven't you?
i suspected something
  like this.
you're always acting
  like you know what's
  going to happen.
like you've seen it
  all before.
so...
i have a request for
  you.
i kind of have a
  secret codeword 
  that only i know.
so i know if someone
  tells it to me...
they'll have to be a
  time traveller.
crazy, right?
anyway, here it is...
(whisper, whisper)
i'm counting on you to
  come back here and
  tell me that.
see you later.
huh?
do you have something
  to say to me?
what? a codeword?
can you speak a
  little louder?
did you...
... just say "i'm a
  stupid doodoo butt?"
wow.
i can't believe you
  would say that.
not only is that
  completely infantile...
but it's also my
  secret codeword.
that, however, isn't
  good enough.
what you need is the
  secret secret codeword.
it's only for people
  that know the secret
  codeword.
anyway, here it is...
(whimsper, whimsper)...
... just say "i'm the
  legendary fartmaster?"
wow.
that's... uh...
really childish.
why would you think
  that was a secret
  secret codeword?
whoever told you that
  is a dirty liar.
i don't have a secret
  secret codeword.
however.
i do have a secret
  secret triple-secret
  codeword.
which you just said.
so, i guess you're
  qualified.
here's the key to my
  room.
it's time...
you learned the truth.
huh?
triple secret codeword?
nah, i'm out of
  material.
heya.
you've been busy,
  huh?
so, i've got a
  question for ya.
do you think even
  the worst person can
  change...?
that everybody can be
  a good person, if
  they just try?
you look frustrated
  about something.
guess i'm pretty good
  at my job, huh?
hmm.
that expression...
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  twice in a row.
suffice to say, you
  look really...
unsatisfied.
all right.
how 'bout we make it
  a third?
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  thrice in a row.
hey, what comes after
  "thrice," anyway?
wanna help me find out?
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  quice in a row.
quice?
frice?
welp, won't have to
  use it again anyways.
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  five times in a row.
convenient, huh?
that's one for each
  finger.
but soon...
you'll need a cool
  mutant hand to count
  all of your deaths.
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  six times in a row.
that's the number of
  fingers on a mutant
  hand.
you'll need to find
  a mutant hand with
  even more fingers.
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  seven times in a row.
hey, that's good.
seven's supposed to be
  a lucky number.
who knows, maybe
  you'll hit the
  jackpot...
and that number will
  multiply tenfold.
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  eight times in a row.
that's the number of
  fingers on a spider.
wait, don't spiders
  have legs?
nope, wait, that's
  definitely nine, sorry.
or was it ten?
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  ten times in a row.
hey, congrats!
the big one-oh!
let's invite all your
  friends over for a
  big shindig.
we can have pie, and
  hot dogs, and...
hmmm... wait.
something's not right.
you don't have any
  friends.
that's the expression
  of someone who's died
  eleven times in a row.
well, give or take.
there's nuance to
  this stuff.
don't think i'll be
  able to count very
  well from here.
count for me, ok?
we'll start from 12.
let's just get to
  the point.
that expression that
  you're wearing...
well, i won't grace
  it with a description.
you're really kind
  of a freak, huh?
heh heh heh heh...
all right.
well, here's a better
  question.
do you wanna have
  a bad time?
'cause if you take
  another step
  forward...
you are REALLY not
  going to like what
  happens next.
welp.
sorry, old lady.
this is why i never
  make promises.
fast shortcut, huh?
hey, everyone.
nah, i haven't had
  breakfast in at least
  half an hour.
you must be thinking
  of brunch.
here, get comfy.
eh, forgeddaboudit.
you can have mine.
i'm not hungry anyway.
anyway, cool or not,
  you have to agree
  papyrus tries real hard.
like how he keeps
  trying to be part of
  the royal guard.
one day, he went to
  the house of the head
  of the royal guard...
and begged her to
  let him be in it.
of course, she shut
  the door on him because
  it was midnight.
but the next day, she
  woke up and saw him
  still waiting there.
seeing his dedication,
  she decided to give
  him warrior training.
it's, uh, still a
  work in progress.
oh yeah, I wanted
  to ask you something.
welp, that was a
  long break.
i can't believe i let
  ya pull me away from
  work for that long.
just kidding.
grillby, put it on
  my tab.
by the way...
... i was going to say
  something, but i forgot.
hey
guys...
what's
up?
oh hey...
i recognize your
voice, too.
the
name's
sans.
and, uh,
same.
huh?
you haven't
beaten
this guy yet?
come on, this
weirdo's got
nothin' on you.
Sans (call)
hey.
is your refrigerator
  running?
nice.
i'll be over to deposit
  the brewskis.
ok, i'll send someone
  over to fix it.
thanks for letting me
  know.
good communication is
  important.
don't worry.
i am.
yep.
that's why i'm
  missing work, too.
light sea green.
light sea foam
  green.
are you kidding?
spiders love to surf
  the web.
the sign outside
  says "lab."
like... laboratory.
i mean.
i wouldn't rule it
  out.
heya.
is anyone there...?
well, i'll just leave
  a message...
well... just calling
  to say.
you made a snowman
  really happy.
... guess i should
  say something else,
  too.
it's been a while.
shouldn't you SAVE?
well... just calling
  to ask.
did you ever take
  off that gross
  bandage...?
did you ever get
  something to eat?
you really like to
  challenge yourself,
  huh...?
well... good job.
just promise not to
  brag about it,
  okay?
alright, i've got the
  number.
so...
it's been a while.
the queen returned, and
  is now ruling over
  the underground.
she's enstated a new
  policy...
all the humans who fall
  here will be treated
  not as enemies...
but as friends.
it's probably for the
  best, anyway.
the human souls the king
  gathered...
seem to have
  disappeared.
so, uh, that plan
  ain't happening any
  time soon.
but even though people
  are heartbroken over
  the king...
... and things are
  looking grim for our
  freedom...
the queen's trying her
  best not to let us
  give up hope.
so, uh, hey...
if we're not giving
  up down here...
don't give up wherever
  you are, ok?
who knows how long
  it will take...
but we will get out
  of here.
that's a promise.
oh, nobody.
here, knock yourself
  out.
we wouldn't get the
  phone back for at
  least a few hours.
oh, whoops.
this thing's almost
  outta batteries.
so, hate to cut this
  short, but...
be seeing you, ok,
  buddy?
the queen returned, and
  attempted to resume
  ruling the underground.
she enstated a new
  policy...
all the humans who fall
  here would be treated
  not as enemies...
...
but people REALLY
  didn't like that
  policy.
because of you, not
  only was the king
  gone...
but the human souls
  had gone missing as
  well...
along with the lives
  of countless citizens.
along with the life
  of...
along with the life
  of undyne, their
  greatest hero.
nobody wanted to see
  that happen ever again.
so the people started
  a rebellion to
  overthrow the queen.
but, she, uh, pretty
  much gave up peacefully
  when she realized.
so she went back
  to the ruins.
the underground's
  basically an uneasy
  anarchy now.
everyone's trying to
  live life like they
  always have...
but it's not really
  easy, you know?
when all of your
  hope has pretty much
  been thrown away...
undyne spearheaded
  the revolution, of
  course.
she was pretty mad
  after what happened
  to asgore.
she was pretty mad
  after what happened
  to asgore and alphys.
she threw the queen
  out of the castle
  with her strength.
then she became the
  empress of the
  underground...
and banished the
  queen back to the
  ruins.
seems like undyne's...
hmmm...
even more vehement
  about destroying
  humanity than ASGORE.
...
but hey!
it's not all bad!
she's not so lonely
  anymore.
me and papyrus go
  and visit her...
we bring her books
  from the library,
  or play games...
we've even convinced
  her to leave
  sometimes.
as long as me or
  papyrus stay behind
  to watch for humans.
but papyrus loves
  doing that.
papyrus says hi.
well, i hope things
  are better where
  you are.
later.
when the queen went
  back to the ruins...
i decided to go
  with her.
and i took out some
  books from the
  library, too.
so she won't have
  to read the same
  ones.
she's a good roomie.
we have a lot of
  fun.
you know.
sometimes the queen
  talks about...
how she'd like to
  see you again.
isn't that nice?
i don't have the
  heart to tell her
  what you did.
do you know how she'd
  react?
if i told her that
  'cause she protected
  you...
... you went on to
  kill my brother...?
anyway, never come
  back here.
you are not welcome.
since you left,
  things down here...
are different.
with ASGORE gone...
undyne became the
  ruler of the
  underground.
she's decided to
  destroy every human
  that comes here.
and since the human
  souls disappeared...
she's also looking
  for a new way to
  break the barrier...
and when she does,
  she's going to wage
  war on humanity.
i mean, that was
  asgore's plan, too.
but he was really,
  uh, bad at it.
undyne has also
  expanded the royal
  guard massively.
she says the first
  thing she'll do after
  we get out of here...
is take her army...
and personally hunt
  you down and destroy
  you.
meanwhile...
i've been knocking
  on the door to
  the RUINs...
but the woman that's
  there hasn't been
  answering me.
maybe she's not
  feeling well?
heh.
or maybe she's not
  feeling anything at
  all...?
you'd better watch
  yourself, kid.
things are lookin
  real bad for you.
i've been knocking on
  the door to the
  RUINS...
but that woman hasn't
  been answering me...
oh, just the human.
sure, knock yourself
  out.
so, it's been a
  while.
since you left, things
  have...
gotten interesting.
with ASGORE gone, the
  people looked to
  undyne to rule...
but she was nowhere
  to be found.
so mettaton just
  kind of...
took over?
he's brainwashed
  everyone with his
  stupid TV show.
and made the
  underground into his
  personal paradise.
it's honestly...
kinda disturbing.
as for me?
oh, yeah...
i'm his agent.
so..
it's been a while.
since you left...
things have gotten
  really strange.
overnight, a bunch of
  people mysteriously
  disappeared.
as well as the
  human souls.
people were heart-
  broken. everyone they
  looked up to...
everything they were
  relying on, in one
  night, disappeared.
everyone clamored to
  elect a new ruler as
  fast as possible.
so, uh...
by process of
  elimination...
papyrus became the
  ruler?
why doesn't he talk
  to you about this...
we can't judge
  humans to be all
  good or all bad.
it's been a while,
  huh?
things have gotten
  pretty bad here.
everyone considered a
  leader disappeared
  overnight.
it's gotten so quiet.
there's a bad feeling
  hanging over
  everyone.
like everyone's just
  going to die here,
  trapped in the dark...
... i bet you're
  wondering why i'm
  not the ruler.
eh.
i'm not cut out
  for something like
  that.
i like to take it
  easy, you know?
... that's a joke.
this is what happens
  when people like me
  take it easy.
see ya.
hey, at least things
  are less crowded.
'cause of all the
  people you killed.
hope that was a good
  experience for you.
just kidding.
i don't really hope
  that.
go to hell.
it seems a number of
  important people
  disappeared overnight.
but no one else was
  harmed.
the people were
  confused.
it was complete bedlam.
somehow, at the end of
  the day...
a small, white dog
  became president of
  the underground.
it sleeps on the
  throne and does
  absolutely nothing.
strangely, it seems
  this is the best
  life for everyone.
thanks.
i'll be honest.
i have no idea what
  happened for you
  to get here.
this is actually some
  sort of error-
  handling message.
so, if you're getting
  this ending...
tell whoever made the
  game, okay?
they'll fix it, or
  if it's a novel
  situation...
they might even add
  another ending to
  the game.
chances are, though...
you're just a dirty
  hacker, aren't you?
yeah, get outta here.
Sans (message)

  teeth before crossing

Scared Donut Guy
I... I... I ended up buying a
  donut...
I... I... I didn't want to, but
  that girl... even though I told
  her no, she...
... kept staring at me in this
  creepy way and licking her
  lips.
N... now I'm outta cash.
Maybe I can sell it online
  and double my money back...
On the surface, I won't
  buy any donuts from
  spiders.
That's my resolution.
Scarf Lady
I love working on the
  newspaper.
There's so little to report
  that we just fill it with
  comics and games.
Yes.
I illustrate all of the
  comics myself.
Yes.
I give everyone huge beautiful
  eyes and giant muscles.
Oh my, there's so much
  news to report, I don't know
  where to begin!
How about this headline...
"Monsters Go Free From The
  Underground."
Nah, that doesn't have
  enough pizazz...
How about "Top 10 Monsters
  You Won't Believe Got Freed
  From The Underground?"
Oh, sorry.
I'm still writing that one.
Scarf Lady (book)
(Here I am...

Scarf Mouse
Everyone is always laughing
  and cracking jokes, trying
  to forget our modern crises...
Dreariness.
Crowding.
Lack of sunlight.
I would join them, but I'm
  just not very funny.
At least I'm not making puns.
Wait!
I've got a joke!
Knock knock!
... Uh.
That's all I've thought of.
Looks like I don't have
  to worry about cracking
  jokes anymore.
I was going to say a joke
  here, but I really don't
  have one.
It just feels like...
Like everything is getting
  worse and worse.

Skateboard Girl
We were hanging out
  when suddenly, a buncha puzzles
  reactivated out of nowhere.
This is a huge problem...
It rules! They've GOTTA
  cancel school over this!
Wait a second...
Auuuugh, it's summer vacation!
Hey, did you hear?
The barrier's opened up!
Now school HAS to be
  cancelled, right!?
Why should we bother going
  to school, anyway...?
This world's got no future.

Ahh, what a beautiful knock...!
Maybe if I don't answer,
  I'll hear it again.
Ahh, my patience rewards me.
Ahh...
Snowdin Shopkeeper
Take your time.
Hello, traveller.
How can I help you?
What would
you like
to buy?
Thanks for
your
purchase.
Just
looking?
That's not
enough
money.
You're
carrying
too much.
Care to
chat?
Huh?
Sell somethin'?
Does this look like a
  pawn shop?
I don't know how it works where
  you come from... but...
If I started spending money
  on old branches and used
  bandages, I'd be out of business
  in a jiffy!
If you're really hurtin' for
  cash, then maybe you could
  do some crowdfunding.
I hear people will pay for
  ANYTHING nowadays.
Bye now!
Come again sometime!
Hiya! Welcome to Snowdin!
I can't remember the last
  time I saw a fresh face around
  here.
Where did you come from?
The capital?
You don't look like a tourist.
Are you here by yourself?
I mean, it happened to you,
  right?
There was a strange flash of
  white light...
Then I felt my body being pulled
  into... something.
Then, suddenly, everything was
  back to normal.
You want to know what to do
  here in Snowdin?
Grillby's has food, and the
  library has information...
If you're tired, you can take
  a nap at the inn.
It's right next door - my sister
  runs it.
And if you're bored, you can
  sit outside and watch those wacky
  skeletons do their thing.
There's two of 'em...
Brothers, I think.
They just showed up one day
  and...
... asserted themselves.
The town has gotten a lot
  more interesting since then.
I heard that it was all 'cause
  a human came through here.
A human...
I can hardly believe it!
Well if they decide to stop
  in, I'll be sure to give
  them a hero's welcome.
Think back to your history
  class...
A long time ago, monsters lived
  in the RUINS back there in
  the forest.
Long story short, we all decided
  to leave the ruins and head
  for the end of the caverns.
Along the way, some fuzzy folk
  decided they liked the cold
  and set up camp in Snowdin.
Oh, and don't think about
  trying to explore the RUINS...
The door's been locked for
  ages.
So unless you're a ghost
  or can burrow under the door,
  forget about it.
Didja hear?
The RUINS have been opened up,
  and get this...
They were opened from the
  INSIDE.
Apparently the Queen had been
  staying inside there for God
  knows how long.
Pretty unbelievable, huh!?
Life is the same as usual.
A little claustrophobic...
But... we all know deep down
  that freedom is coming, don't we?
As long as we got that hope, we
  can grit our teeth and face the
  same struggles, day after day...
That's life, ain't it?
Well, I suppose I'll move
  my store to the overworld...
... haven't planned much
  more than that, I'm afraid.
Snowdin Shopkeeper (note)
Please don't hurt my family.

Thanks,

What are
YOU

at?!?
Is that
s'posed
to be
funny?
Ha...
Ha...
Nice
try.
I've
heard
that
one.
THIS
won't be

either!
Is your

I don't

way...
It's

when I
do it...
ASRIEL, wracked
with grief,
absorbed the
human's SOUL.
He transformed
into a being
with incredible
power.
I ran away from home.
Why?
'Cause my father was so
  "cold" to me...
WHAT!?
It's a JOKE!!
LAUGH at it!!
I really don't!
I don't care if he doesn't
  like my jokes!
Mom might have to share her
  mind with other people now,
  but she's still my mom.
And that's "cool!"
'Cause, uhh, we're made
  of ice and stuff.
WHAT!?!?
It's a JOKE!!
LAUGH at it!!
Snowdrake's Father
I'm the resort comedian.
I'm very funny.
People laugh at my jokes.
Now, my son.
He wants to be a comedian
  like his fathah.
But his jokes.
Aren't funny.
He tells these awful puns.
He's an embarrassment to
  our family.
That's not funny.
Since his mothah passed on,
  he couldn't stand.
Living at home anymore.
So he ran away.
I haven't seen him since.
I'm a terrible fathah.
Ha ha ha ha...
That's not funny.
Talking to you about
  this...
It's breakin' my heart.
The doctah.
She brought my wife.
Back from the dead.
My son.
He seems happy again.
Our family.
It's biggah than evah.
Now that my wife.
Is combined.
With 16 othah people.
My boss stopped answering my
  calls.
I don't know when my next
  performance will be.
Maybe I shouldn't try to be
  a comedian anymore...
It's tearing my family apart.
My son...
He was always making these
  weird ice puns.
I hated them, so he ran
  away from home...
I think I should try to
  patch things up with him.
Have you seen him?
Have you seen my son?

Snowed Inn Keeper
Welcome to Snowed Inn!
Snowdin's premier hotel!
Back again?
Well, stay as long as you
  like.
What?
No, you can't get a
  second key!
Hello!
Sorry, no time for a
  nap...
Snowed Inn is shutting
  down so we can all go
  to the surface.
Oh, there you are.
I was worrying about
  you!
Things are going to be OK,
  you hear?
We're all going to the
  surface world soon...
There's bound to be a
  place you can stay there!
Here's your room key.
Make sure to bundle up!
... You don't even have 80G?
Oh! You poor thing.
I can only imagine what
  you've been through.
One of the rooms upstairs
  is empty.
You can sleep there for
  free, okay?
You aren't carrying enough
  money.
Well, feel free to come
  back any time.
Hiya!
You look like you
  had a great sleep.
Which is incredible, because
  you were only up there for
  about two minutes...
Here's your money back.
You can pay me if you're
  going to stay overnight.
Feel free to come back
  if you get tired.
Snowed Inn Keeper and Frisk
One night is 80G.
 
         Stay        Leave
How about it?
 
         Stay        Leave
Snowed Inn Keeper's Child
Mom says that sleeping
  can recover your health
  above your maximum HP.
... what's maximum HP?
Mom says that we can
  go to the surface world
  now!
... what's so great about
  that, anyway?
I don't wanna move.
Snowman
I shouldn't have given myself
  away so easily...
Did you just...
Consume the part of me
  I had given you?
In front of my very eyes!?
I have no words for you...
Begone!
Thank you for taking care
  of me...
Huh? Again...?
I'm sorry... if I give you
  any more, there will be
  nothing left of me.
I suppose it is true.
Travelling beyond our limits
  is but a fantasy.
It's no different for
  anyone else.
All of monsterkind
  are doomed to stay
  underground, forever...
How am I doing?
By "I" I mean the piece
  of me I gave you...
Huh? You lost it...?
... I suppose I can give
  you another piece...
You don't have any room?
OK... I understand I am not
  a priority for you, then.
Please be careful this
  time.
Hello.
I am a snowman.
I want to see the world...
But I cannot move.
If you would be so kind,
  traveller, please...
It seems you do not
  have enough room for me.
Thank you... good luck!
I see.
Good journey, then.
Oh?
About that piece I gave you?
... I never gave you anything.
Ah... I can feel that piece
  of me has been well taken
  care of.
Hmmm...?
The barrier's opened up?
Hmmm...
Then, if it's not too much
  to ask...
... could you take that
  piece of me to the surface?
I would really appreciate
  it.
So, did you take that
  piece of me very far
  away...?
Where's the piece!?
Ah, the barrier's open...?
You know I cannot move.
Why are you telling me?
To mock me?
Everyone may think you are a
  good person, but this snowman
  knows the truth.
Someday, your friends will
  realize your heart is as
  cold as my butt.
Hello.
I am a snowman.
I cannot move.
Traveller, if you could...
Oh me, oh my.
What are you doing?
Soon there won't be any
  of me left...
Stop...
Please...
Snowman and Frisk
Take a piece of me and
  bring it very far away.
         Yes         No       
So Sorry
AHHHHHHH!!!!!
AHHHHH!!!
Oh!
Whoops!
That hurt!
So sorry, I must
have gotten in the
way!
I really shouldn't
stand so close
Ah I'm just being
troublesome
Darn it, I keep
getting in the way
So sorry, I'm such
an oaf
Wandering in front
of you...
Are you...
trying to KILL me?
... so sorry, but
I've had a really
tough year.
I don't know if I
could take you
killing me on top
of everything.
You should find
someone else to
kill.
So sorry.
?????
I just said I'm
not interested in
the offer!!
...
Sorry, I must not
have enunciated
clearly enough.
I am not interested
in being killed.
Thank you very much.
Look, stranger
I... I guess I'm
going to have to
tell the truth.
My whole life, I've
never been worth a
lot of EXP.
Everyone else at my
work, in my classes,
Would raise a
person's LV by 4
or 5 when
destroyed...
But me?
I wouldn't even
increase your LV
at LV 1.
For this reason...
I...
I've always been...
I've never been
very good at
getting killed.
So...
I'm flattered
that you...
Want to destroy me.
But you are making
a big waste of
your time!!
Stop killing me!!!
OK, OK. Hm.
If you stop killing
me, I'll pay you
200G.
220G?
300G?
W...
Wait a second.
You trying to
kill me...
C...
could it be...?
Because you
don't like me
very much...?
No, no, that
can't be!
This is just a
friendly, um,
killing between
acquaintances!!!
Pals... we're...
we're still pals,
right!!
OK, maybe not
PALS, but, uh,
Friendly strangers?
You know, just
one step away from
being buds!!!
I mean, I was
practically...
I was about to
crack open the
sparkling cider!
Pull out some
baguettes and some
swiss cheese!
BLOW ON A FREAKING
PARTY HORN!!!
N... no, you don't
like me either,
huh...?
Nobody likes me...
they're just putting
up with me
I'm just annoying
you... I should just
leave
ARRRRRGHHHH!!!
Why am I such an
idiot??!?!!!!
How did I not
see it before!!!
You weren't killing
me because you
LIKED me!!!
NOBODY does that!
 That's NOT a thing!
Oh. Sorry. I was
being too loud.
Ugh.
I'm wasting your
time, aren't I...?
... whew, I feel
really...
strange.
I think I need to
go home and lie
down.
Oh, I'm so sorry!
How clumsy of me...
I've bumped into you
I'm such a klutz.
I was just here to
find something to
draw, and...
Oh no, it's ok!
It's OK!
I'll give you a
gift to make up
for your troubles.
Let me look in
my vest!
Ummm, I couldn't
find anything I
want to give away.
Wait, wait!
I've got my notebook!
I can draw you a
picture in it!
I'm quite the artist,
you know.
I'll draw you a
GREAT picture!!!
S.. sorry...
The drawing didn't
come out very well.
Wait!
I know the problem!
I just have to
find a better piece
of paper for it!
None of my papers
are good enough to
use...
IT'S OK!!!
I know what I
can do!!
I'll use my magic
pencil!
It has to be under
some of these papers
somewhere!!!!
Here!
I got it!
My magic pencil is
amazing!
Everything I draw
with it looks...
COMPLETELY REAL!
I've messed up.
I've really messed up.
Oh no.
I'll just use a
regular pencil!
I'll try my best!
Are you ready!?
I just finished.
Here's your picture!
What do you think!?
It's a representation
of your deepest
essence...
It's great, right!?
(They think my art
is terrible.)
Well!
I'll leave you with
that thought!
Goodbye!
See you later!
Sayonara!
Nice knowing ya!
Hasta la vista.
I should leave.
Oh, and...
About all this.
Um.
Sorry.
Uuuuhhhh, oh no!!
That's a little too

This way.
Welcome to your new
  home, innocent one.
Allow me to educate you
  in the operation of the
  RUINS.
The RUINS are full of
  puzzles.
Ancient fusions between 
  diversions and doorkeys.
One must solve them
  to move from room to
  room.
Please adjust yourself    to the sight of them.
To make progress here, 
  you will need to trigger
  several switches.
Do not worry, I have 
  labelled the ones that
  you need to flip.
Do not worry, I have 
  labelled the ones that
  you need to flip.
... eh?
It seems that the
  labelling has worn away.
Oh dear.
This might be far more
  challenging than I
  anticipated...
The first switch is over
  on the wall.
Do you need some help..?
Press the switch on the   wall.
Come on, you can do it!
Go on, press the switch
  on the left.
I believe it was
  the switch on the
  left.
You do know which way
  left is, do you not?
Press the switch that I
  labelled for you.
You do know which way
  left is, do you not?
You are very curious, 
  are you not?
Please understand. 
 I only want the best
  for you.
Splendid! 
I am proud of you, 
  little one.
Let us move to the
  next room.
As a human living in
  the UNDERGROUND, 
  monsters may attack you.
You will need to be
  prepared for this
  situation.
However, worry not! 
The process is simple.
When you encounter a 
  monster, you will enter
  a FIGHT.
While you are in a
  FIGHT, strike up a
  friendly conversation.
Stall for time.
  I will come to resolve
  the conflict.
Practice talking to
  the dummy.
Ahh, the dummies are
  not for fighting! 
They are for talking!
We do not want to hurt
  anybody, do we...?  
Come now.
Ah, very good! 
You are very good.
...
... you ran away...
Truthfully, that was
  not a poor choice.
It is better to
  avoid conflict
  whenever possible.
That... however, is
  only a dummy.
It cannot harm you.
It is made of cotton.
It has no desire
  for revenge...
Nevermind.
Stay close to me and
  I will keep you safe.
...
...
The next room awaits.
Practice talking to
  the dummy.
You can say anything... 
I do not think the dummy
  will be bothered.
Do you need some
  ideas for conversation
  topics?
Well, I often start with
  a simple 'how do you
  do...'
You could ask them about
  their favorite books...
Jokes can be useful for
  'breaking the ice.'
Listen to this one...
What did the skeleton
  tile his roof with?
... SHIN-gles!
Well, I thought it
  was amusing.
You can say anything... 
The dummy will not
  be bothered.
There is another puzzle
  in this room...
I wonder if you can
  solve it?
This is the puzzle,
  but...
Here, take my hand
  for a moment.
Puzzles seem a little
  too dangerous for
  now.
...
Greetings, my child.
Do not worry, I did
  not leave you.
I was merely behind this
  pillar the whole time.
Thank you for trusting
  me.
However, there was an
  important reason for
  this exercise.
... to test your
  independence.
I must attend to some
  business, and you must
  stay alone for a while.
Please remain here.
It's dangerous to
  explore by yourself.
I have an idea.
I will give you a
  CELL PHONE.
If you have a need for
  anything, just call.
Be good, alright?
You have done
  excellently thus
  far, my child.
However... I have a
  difficult request to ask
  of you.
...
I would like you to walk
  to the end of the room
  by yourself.
Forgive me for this.
Hello there,
  little one!
The pie has not
  cooled down yet.
Sweet dreams.
You'd rather stay
  up and chat with
  me, then?
Up already, I see?
Um, I want you to know
  how glad I am to
  have someone here.
There are so many
  old books I want
  to share.
I want to show you
  my favorite bug-
  hunting spot.
I've also prepared
  a curriculum for
  your education.
This may come as
  a surprise to you...
But I have always
  wanted to be a
  teacher.
... actually, perhaps
  that isn't very
  surprising.
STILL.
I am glad to have
  you living here.
Oh, did you
  want something?
Well, talk to me
  again if you
  need anything.
What?
This... this IS your
  home now.
Um... would you like
  to hear about this
  book I am reading?
Oh, hello!
Did you want to
  hear about the
  book I am reading?
It is called
  "72 Uses for Snails."
Here is an exciting
  snail fact.
Um...
How about an exciting
  snail fact?
Did you know
  that snails...
Have a chainsaw-like
  tongue called a
  radula?
Sometimes flip their
  digestive systems
  as they mature?
Make terrible
  shoelaces?
Talk. Really. Slowly?
Just kidding, snails
  don't talk.
Well, bother me
  if you need anything
  else.
... I have to do
  something.
Stay here.
If you need anything,
  just ask.
... I have to do
  something.
Stay here..
What a terrible
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent youth...
Ah, do not be
afraid, my child.
I am TORIEL,
caretaker of
the RUINS.
I pass through this
place every day to
see if anyone has
fallen down.
You are the first
human to come here
in a long time.
I will do my best
to ensure your
protection during
your time here.
Come!
I will guide you
through the
catacombs.
Oh, may I enter
  the trash as well?
On second thought,
  do not put me
  in the trash.
Oh my...
Yes, it is beautiful,
  is it not?
But we should really
  think about what comes
  next.
Frisk...
You came from this
  world, right...?
So you must have
  a place to return to,
  do you not?
What will you do
  now?
Welcome to your new
  home, innocent one.
Allow me to educate you
  in the operation of
  the RUINS.
I think you should
think of your own
name, my child.
   
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 ...?
 What are
 you
 doing?
 Attack
 or run
 away!
 What are
 you
 proving
 this way?
 Fight me
 or
 leave!
 Stop it.
 Stop
 looking
 at me
 that way.
 Go away!
 ...
 ...
 ...
I know you want
to go home, but...
But please... go
upstairs now.
I promise I will
take good care
of you here.
I know we do not
have much, but...
We can have a
good life here.
Why are you
making this so
difficult?
Please, go upstairs.
.....
Ha ha...
Pathetic, is it not?
I cannot save even
a single child.
No, I understand.
You would just be
unhappy trapped
down here.
The RUINS are very
small once you
get used to them.
It would not be
right for you to
grow up in a
place like this.
My expectations...
My loneliness...
My fear...
For you, my child...
I will put them aside.
Urgh...
You are stronger
than I thought...
Listen to me,
 small one...
If you go beyond
this door,
Keep walking as
far as you can.
Eventually you will
reach an exit.
...
....
ASGORE...
Do not let ASGORE 
take your soul.
His plan
cannot be allowed
to succeed.
......
Be good,
won't you?
My child.      
Y... you...
really hate me
that much?
Now I see who I
was protecting by
keeping you here.
Not you...
But them!
Ha... ha... 
You...
... at my most
vulnerable
moment...
To think I was
worried you
wouldn't fit
in out there...
Eheheheh!!!
You really are
no different than
them!
This is
for your
own
good.
No one
will
leave
again.
Your fate is up to
you now!
Eh??
You are ending
it NOW?
And on such a
dramatic moment...?
But there WILL be
more, will there
not?
Well.
What is the point
of that now?
Hmmm.
Perhaps I will
bake another pie.
That last one ended
up a little burnt.
You are just going
to eat it all...
Snoring on the
floor is NOT help.
It's over.
No no no!
You want to press the
  other switch.
I even labelled it for
  you...
It seems that is not
  the correct switch.
Do not worry about
  me.
Someone has to take
  care of these flowers.
Hello...
Are you all right?
You must be so lost
  and confused...
Ah, do not be
  afraid, my child.
I am TORIEL,
  caretaker of the
  RUINS.
I pass through here
  every day to see if
  anyone has fallen down.
You are the first
  human to come here
  in a long time.
I will do my best
  to protect you during
  your time here.
Come!
I shall guide you
  through the catacombs.
How did you get
  here, my child?
Are you hurt?
Not a scratch...
Impressive!
But still...
There, there, I will
  heal you.
Who did this to you? 
You will get an apology.
I should not have
  left you alone
  for so long.
It was irresponsible
  to try to surprise
  you like this.
Err...
Well, I suppose I
  cannot hide it
  any longer.
Come, small one!
Oh dear, that took
  longer than I
  thought it would.
Do you smell that?
Surprise!
It is a butterscotch-
  cinnamon pie.
I thought we might
  celebrate your
  arrival.
I want you to have
  a nice time living
  here.
So I will hold off
  on snail pie for
  tonight.
Here, I have another
  surprise for you.
Er, I assume that
  expression means you
  do.
S... surprise!
I have baked a snail
  pie.
So I...
Here, I have another
  surprise for you.
This is it...
Is something burning...?
Um, make yourself
  at home!
A room of your own.
I hope you like it!
I think you should
  play upstairs
  instead.
It is dangerous
  to play here.
It is drafty here.
You will catch
  a cold.
It is dusty here.
You will catch
  a cough.
There is nothing
  to see here.
Do you want to
  read a book?
I do not like
  the game you
  are playing.
Why not go for
  a walk in the
  yard?
Really now.
...
Hey, do not go down
  here.
I have something
  to show you
  upstairs.
You wish to know how
  to return "home,"
  do you not?
Ahead of us lies the
  end of the RUINS.
A one-way exit to the
  rest of the underground.
I am going to destroy
  it.
No one will ever
  be able to leave
  again.
Now be a good child
  and go upstairs.
Every human that falls
  down here meets
  the same fate.
I have seen it
  again and again.
They come.
They leave.
They die.
You naive child...
If you leave the
  RUINS...
They...
ASGORE...
Will kill you.
I am only protecting
  you, do you understand?
... go to your room.
Do not try to stop me.
This is your final
  warning.
Goodbye, my child.
That is right.
Go upstairs.
If you truly wish to
  leave the RUINS...
I will not stop you.
However, when you
  leave...
Please do not come
  back.
I hope you understand.
You want to leave
  so badly?
Hmph.
You are just like
  the others.
There is only one
  solution to this.
Prove yourself...
Prove to me you
  are strong enough
  to survive.
Prove to me you
  are strong enough
  to survive!
... wait.
... why are you looking
  at me like that?
Like you have seen
  a ghost.
Do you know something
  that I do not?
No...
That is impossible.
Prove to me that you
  are...
Hey, let me finish
Already?
What will it take
  for you to learn
  your lesson?
It seems that everyone
  is quite eager to
  set off.
Frisk...
You really are a
  funny child.
If you had said that
  earlier, none of this
  would have happened.
It is a good thing
  you took so long to
  change your mind.
Hee hee hee.
Well...
I suppose.
If you really do
  not have any other
  place to go...
I will do my best to
  take care of you, for
  as long as you need.
All right?
Now, come along.
Everyone is waiting
  for us!
Ah.
... I see.
Well, I hope that
  I am not keeping
  you.
"See you around."
  Frisk!
  This is all just
  a bad dream...!
  Please, wake up...!
Oh!
You are awake!
Thank goodness!
Errr...
How about we give
  them space, first?
They must be very
  exhausted.
Though, from what,
  I am not certain.
Frisk...
We do not remember
  exactly what happened.
There was a flower...
And then, everything
  went white.
But now the barrier
  is gone.
When you are ready,
  we will all return
  to the surface.
It seems the door to
  the east will lead
  us there now.
But before then...
Perhaps you might
  want to take a
  walk?
You can say goodbye
  to all of your
  wonderful friends.
Do as you wish.
We will all wait
  for you here.
Hello, Frisk.
Alphys upgraded my
  phone.
I am having a lot
  of fun with the
  "texting" feature.
Sans, "check out" this
  one.
Worry not, Papyrus.
We are texting for
  a good reason.
Sans, please do
  not say that.
You are not a dork.
You are more of
  a bonehead!
Frisk, do not feel
  left out.
I have been writing
  messages to you as
  well!
You still have my
  phone number after
  all this time...
Do you not?
Frisk, how about
  you go look around
  before we all go?
Seeing how many good
  friends you've made
  here...
I am almost certain
  you must have made
  some more.
Sans, did I tell you
  about the time Frisk
  flirted with me...?
And then asked to
  call me "mother?"
I felt so embarrassed
  for them.
Oh, do I ever!
But, I think that
  story is one of the
  most unbelievable.
It is hard to think
  anyone would want to
  flirt with me.
Well, it was not
  RIGHT after.
It took a couple
  minutes.
Oh, I should bake it
  for everyone sometime!
Certainly!
It would be fun to
  cook together!
Hmmm... Flying sounds
  a little dangerous.
Who the hell is Sans?
Who the HECK is Sans?
What a miserable
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent, youth...
Do not be afraid,
my child.
It is I, TORIEL,
your friend and
guardian.
At first, I thought
I would let you
make your journey
alone...
But I could not
stop worrying about
you.
Your adventure must
have been so
treacherous.
... and ultimately,
it would burden you
with a horrible
choice.
To leave this place,
you would have to
take the life of
another person.
You would have to
defeat ASGORE.
However...
I realized...
I cannot allow that.
It is not right to
sacrifice someone
simply to let
someone leave here.
Is that not what
I have been trying to
prevent this
whole time?
So, for now, let
us suspend this
battle.
As terrible as
ASGORE is...
He deserves mercy,
too.
Do not "Tori" me,
Dreemurr!
You pathetic whelp.
If you really wanted
to free our kind...
You could have gone
through the barrier
after you got ONE
SOUL...
... taken six SOULs
from the humans, then
come back and freed
everyone peacefully.
But instead, you made
everyone live in
despair...
Because you would
rather wait here,
meekly hoping another
human never comes.
(Sigh.)
NO,
Asgore.
Hello.
I am
TORIEL.
Are you
the
human's
friend?
It is
nice to
meet
you.
Oh!
Are you
another
friend?
I am
TORIEL.
Hello!
Hello!
That
voice
...!!
Hello,
I think
we
may...
Know
each
other?
I am
TORIEL.
So nice
to meet
you.
Oh!
Wait,
then...!
This must be your
brother, Papyrus!
Greetings, Papyrus!
It is so nice to
finally meet you!
Your brother has
told me so much
about you.
Hey, Papyrus...
What does a skeleton
tile his roof
with?
No, silly!
A skeleton tiles
his roof with...
SHIN-gles!!!
W-wait!
Not in
front of
the
human!
Hee hee hee.
My child, it seems
as if you must
stay here
for a while.
But looking at
all the great
friends you have
made...
I think...
I think you will
be happy here.
Do not be afraid,
my child...
No matter what
happens...
We will always
be there to
protect you!
Toriel (call)
 
Hello?
This is TORIEL.
For no reason in
  particular...
Which do you prefer?
Oh, I see.
Thank you very much!
   
Cinnamon or
  butterscotch?
... wait.
Do not tell me.
Hee hee hee.
I had a feeling.
When humans fall down
  here, strangely...
I...
I often feel like
  I already know them.
Truthfully, when I first
  saw you, I felt...
... like I was seeing
  an old friend for
  the first time.
Strange, is it not?
Well, thank you for
  your selection.
Oh... I see.
Well, thank you.
Goodbye for now.
This is TORIEL.
You only wanted to
  say hello...?
Well then.
'Hello!'
I hope that suffices.
Hee hee.
You want to say
  hello again?
'Salutations!'
Is that enough?
  
Are you bored?
I should have given
  a book to you.
My apologies.
Why not use your
  imagination to
  divert yourself?
Pretend you are...
A monarch!
Rule over the leaf pile
  with a fist of iron.
Can you do that for me?
Hello, my child.
Sorry, I do not have
  much to say.
It was nice to hear
  your voice, though.
This is TORIEL.
Help with a puzzle...?
Um, you have not
  left the room, have you?
Wait patiently for
  me and we can solve
  it together!
You want to know
  more about me?
Well, I am afraid there
  is not much to say.
I am just a silly little
  lady who worries too
  much!
Huh?
Did you just call
  me... "Mom"?
Well...
I suppose...
Would that make you
  happy?
To call me...
"Mother?"
Well then, call me
  whatever you like!!
... huh???
Oh, heh.. heh...  
Ha ha ha!
How adorable... I
  could pinch your cheek!
You can certainly find
  better than an old woman
  like me.
Oh dear, are you
  serious...?
I do not know if this is
  pathetic, or endearing.
And after you said you
  want to call
  me "mother..."
You are an... 
  ... "interesting"
  child.
Hey, you silly
  child.
If you want to
  talk to me, I am
  right here.
You can certainly find
  better than an old woman
  like me.
Hello!
This is TORIEL.
My errands are taking
  longer than I thought
  they would.
You must wait 5 more
  minutes.
Thank you for being
  patient.
Hello...
This is TORIEL.
I found what I was
  looking for.
But before I could
  take it...
A small, white puppy
  snatched it away.
How odd.
Do dogs even LIKE
  flour?
Err, that is an
  unrelated question,
  of course.
It will take a little
  longer.
Please understand.
Stop, please!
Come back here with my
  CELLPHONE!
Helloooo?
Little puppy...?
Where are you...?
I will give you a nice pat
  on the head!
... if you return my CELLPHONE.
Here, pup-pup-puppy!
Oh dear, I should not keep
  my guest waiting any longer.
... Oh no, how long has it
  been since I have talked to
  them...?
Perhaps they have been calling
  the phone, and...?
... here, puppy!
Doggie...
Here, doggie...
Oh dear...
I do wonder how they are...
You have not left
  the room, have you?
There are a few puzzles
  ahead that I have
  yet to explain.
It would be dangerous
  to try to solve them
  yourself.
Hello? Hello?
This is TORIEL.
My apologies.
A strange dog
  kidnapped my phone.
So if you called, I
  could not have helped
  you.
However, I have
  recovered it.
And you are still in
  that room, are you not?
What a good child you
  are.
There are a few puzzles
  ahead that I have
  yet to explain.
Be good, alright?
You do not DISLIKE
  butterscotch, do you?
You do not DISLIKE
  cinnamon, do you?
I know what your
  preference is, but...
Would you turn up your
  nose if you found
  it on your plate?
Right, right, I
  understand.
Thank you for being
  patient, by the way.
Hello?
You do not have
  any allergies, do
  you?
Huh?
Why am I asking?
No reason...
No reason at all.
I just realized that it
  has been a while since
  I have cleaned up.
I was not expecting to
  have company so soon.
There are probably a lot
  of things lying about
  here and there.
You can pick them up,
  but do not carry more
  than you need.
Someday you might see
  something you really
  like.
You will want to leave
  room in your pockets
  for that.
I have a question.
You like things other
  than butterscotch or
  cinnamon, too...
Do you not?
... oh, what am I
  asking.
I will keep looking.
Toriel (call) and Frisk
Cinnamon or
  butterscotch?
  Cinnamon    Bscotch 
It is ERROR MESSAGE!
 
  Yes         No      
Is it Butterscotch?
 
  Yes         No      
Is it Cinnamon?
 
  Yes         No

Dear Frisk,
Sans and Alphys are teaching
  me how to text.
I am learning so much.
For example:
Do you know what a
  "smiley" is?
Please look at this:
  ]: )
Now turn your head to the
  left.
It is a picture of me
  smiling at you!
Can you see it?
L-O-L!
(That stands for Lots of
  Laughter.)
Sincerely, Toriel
How are you? You have been
  wandering around for
  quite some time now.
I hope you are not getting
  into trouble.
Only kidding.
L-O-L!
Sincerly, Toriel
PS - Do not get into trouble.
I did not mean to write
  "sincerly."
I meant to say "sincerely."
It is difficult to use this
  with large hands.
Perhaps I should ask Sans
  to transcribe for me.
I did not say any of that.
Greetings.
This is Sans.
I love my brother very much.
This is Sans.
Frisk, did you know that I
  love to "get owned?"
Excuse me
.
Fwd: send this 2 some1 u
  care about... or a skeleton
  will rattle his bones at u
Thought you might enjoy this.
]: )
Undyne and Papyrus want to
  cook something together
  with me.
Sans is telling me that they
  are excellent chefs.
I am excited. ]: )
Maybe if you are lucky, you
  can have some!
If Sans and I started a
  band, do you know what
  we could call it?
"Dreemurr" and "Femur."
L-O-L!
PS - That is only a joke.
Do not refer to me as
  Dreemurr.
Undyne is very strong.
Papyrus made a bet with her
  that she could not lift
  everyone here up.
She could.
The only trouble is that
  she did not know how to
  put everyone down.
Alphys is telling me many
  interesting facts about
  the human world.
Quite a few of them are
  wrong, though.
Frisk, you did not tell
  her anything funny, did you?
]: )
I heard that using the
  computer for too long
  is bad for you.
However, I have not seen
  you use the computer at all.
You must be very healthy!
How nice.
I think I may have to turn
  off the phone for now.
Your friends are all very
  lovely people!
I think I will spend this
  time getting to know
  them better.
Be good, alright?
Sincerely, Toriel.

Psssst.
Gorey, wake up. 
Shush!
I want to get your
  reaction.
Gorey, dearest.
What is my favorite
  vegetable?
No no no!
My FAVORITE vegetable is...
Eda-MOM-e.
... get it???
No no!!
Not yet!
Hee hee hee.
Now, If I were a dog,
  what breed of dog would
  I be?
I would be...
A MOMERANIAN.
Well, I am going to bed.
Hahaha, I know.
I am just teasing you.
Goodnight, dear.
Oh dear, perhaps it is too
  dark in here for the
  video to come out...
...
Can you hear me?
We want you to wake up...
Toriel and Frisk
Perhaps you should
  take a nap.
  Yes         No       
What is it?
               When can
  Nothing      I go home? 
How about it?
              How to exit
  Sure        the RUINS 
Interesting.
              How to exit
  Yeah        the RUINS 
What is it?
              How to exit
  Nothing     the RUINS 
Tsunderplane
It's not
like I
LIKE
you.
Id...
Idiot!
Hmph!
Don't
get in
my way.
>_<...
Human
...
...
H-human
...
...?
Eeeeh?
H-human
...?
Human,
I...
Huh!?
Y-you
sicko!
Ah...
Is that
true...?
No way!
Why
would I
like YOU
B-but I
never
got to
...!
Hey!
Watch where you stand,
  jerk!
Th-though, I guess if
  there's nowhere else, you
  can stand closer...
Standing so spicey.
A-ah... H-human...
You're leaving?
I have...
Something to say to you.
Admittedly, I may have had
  limerent feelings for you
  before.
However, upon examining my
  own actions, I now
  realize...
I did not love YOU.
I was merely infatuated
  with the CONCEPT of love.
The idea of romance, the
  concept of sharing affection
  with another...
Through these desires, I
  built a false concept of
  you in my head.
Such a relationship would
  not have ended well.
In closing, I believe it
  is better that I chose to
  say nothing.
Y... y-you i-idiot.
I'm not saying it again.
H-hey, why do you keep
  following me!!!
You jerk!!!
Eeeeh?
You're walking in the
  opposite direction...?
H-hey, you think you're too
  good for me, huh...?
N-not spicey enough for you,
  h-huh...
I... I'm thinking of going
  to the surface...
Eeeeeh?
You're going to go there
  too?
Idiot...
Quit following me!
Ugly Fish
I "put out a line" for some
  girls today.
Someone told me that there
  are plenty of fish in the
  sea...
Well, I'm taking that
  seriously.
I'm literally going to make
  out with a fish.
I guess I could ask out Undyne.
But I think she likes someone
  already.
Did I catch anyone yet?
I can't bear to look...
Sans is the most regular
  regular of all.
He hasn't been showing up
  as much recently though.
Where the heck is Sans?
He told me he had some
  bait I could use.
Though it was probably
  some kind of prank.
But I wanted to know what
  the prank was!
In the end, I never caught
  any girls on my fishing
  line.
So kid, take it from me...
Don't try to catch hot
  people with a fishing rod.
Hey Sans, weren't you just
  here for breakfast a
  few minutes ago?
Ugly Fish (note)
(Call Me!
  Here's my number!)
(Nevermind, guys!)
Undyne
Seven.
Seven human souls.
With the power of seven
  human souls, our king...
King ASGORE Dreemurr...
... will become a god.
With that power, ASGORE 
  can finally shatter the
  barrier.
He will finally take the
  surface back from humanity...
And give them back the
  suffering and pain that
  we have endured.
Understand, human?
This is your only chance
  at redemption.
Give up your soul...
Or I'll tear it from
  your body.
That spark in your eyes...
You're really eager to
  die, aren't you?
...
So why are YOU
  here?
To rub your victory
  in my face?
To humiliate me
  even further?
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Well, I've got news
  for you, BRAT.
You're on MY
  battlefield now.
And you AREN'T
  going to
  humiliate me.
I'll TELL you
  what's going to
  happen.
We're going to
  hang out.
We're going to
  have a good
  time.
We're going to
  become "friends."
You'll become so
  enamored with me...
YOU'LL be the one
  feeling humiliated
  for your actions!
Fuhuhuhuhu!!
It's the perfect
  revenge!!!
Err...
Why don't you
  have a seat?
Then why are you
  here?
...!
Wait, I get it.
You think that I'm
  gonna be friends
  with you, huh?
Really?
How delightful!!
I accept!
Let's all frolick
  in the fields
  of friendship!
...NOT!
Why would I EVER
  be friends with
  YOU!?
If you weren't my
  houseguest, I'd beat
  you up right now!
You're the enemy
  of everyone's hopes
  and dreams!
I WILL NEVER
  BE YOUR FRIEND.
Now get out of
  my house!
WHAT?
First you parade
  into my house,
  then you INSULT me?
You little BRAT!
I have half a
  mind to...
Wait.
I'll prove you
  WRONG.
We ARE going to
  be friends.
In fact...
We.
Are going to be
  BESTIES.
I'll make you like
  me so much...
Your WHOLE LIFE
  will revolve around
  me!!
FUHUHUHUHU!!!
Now, why don't
  you have a seat?
That sugar's for
  the tea.
I'm not gonna give
  you a cup of
  sugar!
What do I look
  like, the ice-cream
  woman?
Do human ice-cream
  women TERRORIZE HUMANITY
  with ENERGY SPEARS?
Are their ice-cream
  songs a PRELUDE TO
  DESTRUCTION?
... what?
REALLY?
That rules!!!
That's what I
  thought.
Envision these
  vegetables as your
  greatest enemy!
Now!!
Pound them to dust
  with your fists!!
YEAH!
YEAH!
Our hearts are
  uniting against these
  healthy ingredients!
NOW IT'S MY TURN!
NGAHHH!
OH MY GOD!!!
STOP PETTING THE
  ENEMY!!!
I'll show you
  how it's done!
... we add the
  noodles!
Homemade noodles
  are the best!
BUT I JUST BUY
  STORE-BRAND!
THEY'RE THE
  CHEAPEST!!!
NGAHHHHHHHHH
  HHHHHHHHHH!!!
Uhh, just put them
  in the pot.
YEAH!!!
I'M INTO IT!!!
Nice???
Humans suck, but
  their history...
Kinda rules.
Case in point:
This giant sword!
Historically, humans
  wielded swords up
  to 10x their size.
Heh, I knew it!
When I first heard
  that, I immediately
  wanted one!
So me and Alphys
  built a giant
  sword together.
She figured out all
  the specs herself...
She's smart, huh!?
Pfft!
You liar!
I've READ Alphys's
  human history book
  collection!
I know all about
  your giant swords...
Your colossal,
  alien-fighting
  robots...
Your supernatural
  princesses...
Heh! There's no
  way you're gonna
  fool me!!!
So, Alphys...
What do you want
  to do now that
  we're all free?
We have the whole
  world to explore
  now.
Heh.
Papyrus has the
  right idea.
Losing to Frisk is
  the best thing to
  ever happen to me.
So I'm glad that
  we...
Huh?
What is it, Asgore?
... kissing?
Frisk! Stop!
You're breaking his
  big burly heart!
ASGORE! STOP!
YOU'RE BREAKING MY
  BIG BURLY HEART!
OH MY GOD!
YOU'RE GOING BACK
  IN THE TRASH!!!
Sure, Papyrus.
Uh, okay?
SURE!!!
WHY NOT!!!
OH MY GOD!!!
Frisk, you LIVE with
  this!?
The sunlight is so
  nice... and the air
  is so fresh!
I really feel alive!
Get your OWN name!
OH MY GOD!!!
I'M GONNA FREAKIN' KILL
  YOU!!
   
 Hey!!
 There you are!!
 I, uh, realized,
 if you deliver that
  thing...
 It might be a bad
 idea.
 So I'm gonna do
 it!!!
 Give it to me!!!
 Huh!?
 You don't have it!?
 Ngggaaahhh!!
 Have you at least
 seen her!?
 Yes?
 So she's somewhere
 around here...
 Thanks.
 I'll keep looking.
 No???
 But she wasn't
 at home...
 Where the heck
 could she be!?
WHAT did you just
say?
Hey, woah, wait
a second!
Your outfit's really
cute!
What's the occasion?
...
Wait a second.
Are you two...
On a date?
WHAT???
WHAT???
ABOUT WHAT???
Alphys.
Alphys.
Shhhh.
Shhhhhh.
Alphys!
I... think you're
neat, too, I guess.
But, you've gotta
realize...
Most of what you
said really doesn't
matter to me.
I don't care if
you're watching kid
cartoons or reading
history books.
To me, ALL of
that stuff is
just NERDY CRAP!
What I like about
you is that you're
PASSIONATE!
You're ANALYTICAL!!
It doesn't matter
what it is!
YOU CARE ABOUT IT!!
100-PERCENT!!
AT MAXIMUM POWER!!!
... so, you don't
have to lie to me.
I don't want you
to have to lie to
anyone anymore.
Alphys... I want to
help you become
happy with who
you are!
And I know just
the training you
need to do that!
Pffft, what?
ME?
Nah, I'm gonna
get Papyrus to
do it.
Ready?
I'm about to start
the timer!
OH MY GOD!!!
She was kidding,
right!? 
Those cartoons...
those comics...
Those are still
REAL, right!?
ANIME'S REAL,
RIGHT?!?!
HA HA HA!!!
I KNEW IT!!!
GIGANTIC SWORDS!!!
MAGICAL PRINCESSES!
HERE I COME!!!
No... NO!!!!
I CAN FEEL MY
HEART BREAKING
INTO PIECES!!!
...
Uhh, thanks for
taking care of
Alphys.
I didn't get to
say what I wanted
to, but...
Things seem like
they're going to get
better for her.
Well, I gotta go
catch up with
them!
Later!
...
... no, I can
survive this...
I have to be strong.
For Alphys.
Thank you, human,
for telling me
the truth.
I'll try my best to
live in this
world...
See you later!
Ngahhh!
Bring
it on!
C'mon!
Fuhuhu!
Ngahh!!
Urahhh!!
  You're strong...
  But not strong
  enough!
  You're a pain in
  the neck, huh?
  DIE ALREADY, YOU
  LITTLE BRAT!
  As long as you're
  GREEN you CAN'T
  ESCAPE!
  Unless you learn
  to face danger
  head-on...
  You won't last
  a SECOND against
  ME!
  You?
  Sparing ME?
  Fuhuhuhu!
  How insulting!
  I'd NEVER
  surrender to the
  likes of you!
  Not bad!
  Then how about
  THIS!?
  I wanted this to
  be a fair fight.
  I thought if I
  beat you like
  this...
  It'd truly show
  how strong
  monsters can be.
  BUT NOW???
  I DON'T CARE!
  I'M NOT YOUR
  FREAKING
  KINDERGARTEN
  TEACHER!
  Unless your
  kindergarten
  teacher...
  DOES THIS!
  WHAT ARE YOU
  DOING?
  JUST FACE
  UPWARDS!!!
  IT'S NOT HARD!
 
  Look.
  I gave you a
  spear to block
  the bullets with.
  Do I have to
  explain this
  any more
  clearly?
  When I said
  face towards
  danger...
  I meant face
  towards the
  bullets!
  For years,
  we've dreamed
  of a happy
  ending...
  And now,
  sunlight is
  just within
  our reach!
  I won't let
  you snatch it
  away from
  us!
  NGAHHH!
  Enough warming
  up!
  Heh...
  You're tough!
  Mercy!
  Ha!
  I still can't
  believe YOU
  want to spare
  ME!
  But even if
  you could
  beat me...
  But even if
  I spared
  YOU...
  No human has
  EVER made it
  past
  ASGORE!
  Honestly,
  killing you
  now is an act
  of mercy...!
  Honestly, I'm
  doing you
  a favor...
  Killing you
  now is an act
  of mercy!
  So STOP being
  so damn
  resilient!
  What the
  hell are
  humans made
  out of!?
  Anyone else
  would be DEAD
  by now!
  Alphys told me
  humans were
  determined...
  I see now what
  she meant by
  that!
  But I'm
  determined,
  too!
  Determined to
  end this
  RIGHT NOW!
  ... RIGHT NOW!
  ... RIGHT...
  ...
  ... NOW!!
  Ha...
  Ha...
  NGAHHH!!!
  DIE ALREADY, YOU
  LITTLE BRAT!
  YOU'RE GETTING
  IN MY WAY!
  I WILL NEVER
  TAKE MERCY FROM
  THE LIKES OF YOU!
  I WILL NOT
  BE DEFEATED!
  YOU! WILL!
  NEVER! SPARE! ME!
  Come on, is that
  all you've got!?
  ... pathetic.
  You're going to
  have to try
  harder than that!
  S-see how strong
  we are when we
  believe in
  ourselves?
  H... heh...
  Had enough yet?
  ...
  ... I won't...
  ... give up...
...
En guarde!
  You won't get
  away from me
  this time!
  You've escaped
  from me for
  the LAST time!
  STOP RUNNING
  AWAY!!!
  COME BACK HERE,
  YOU LITTLE
  PUNK!!
Ngahhh...
You were stronger...
Than I thought...
So then...
... this is where...
... it ends...
  No...
NO!
I won't die!
Alphys...
Asgore...
Papyrus...
Everyone is counting
on me to protect
them!
NNNNGAH!
Human!
In the name of
everybody's hopes
and dreams...
I WILL DEFEAT YOU!
Ha... ha...
... Alphys...
This is what I
  was afraid of...
This is why I
  never told you...
No...
No!
Not yet!
I won't die!
NGAHHHHHHHH!!! 
 I WON'T DIE! 
 I WON'T 
Show me what
you've got!
Do your worst!
What's the
matter, scared?
What the hell
is the holdup?
COME ON ALREADY!
IT'S GETTING
HOT IN HERE!
I've been
defeated...
My house is in
shambles...
I even failed to
befriend you.
That's it.
I don't care if
you're my guest
anymore.
One final rematch!
All out on both
sides!!!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN REGAIN MY
LOST PRIDE!!!
NOW COME ON!
HIT ME WITH
ALL YOU'VE GOT!
NGAHHHH!!!
What.
That's the best
you can manage?
Even attacking at
full force...
You just can't
muster any intent
to hurt me,
huh?
Heh, you know
what?
I don't actually
want to hurt you
either.
At first, I hated
your stupid
saccharine
schtick, but...
The way you hit
me right now,
it...
Reminded me of
someone I used
to train with.
Now I know you
aren't just some
wimpy loser.
You're a wimpy
loser with a
big heart!
Just like him...
Listen, human.
It seems that you
and ASGORE are
fated to fight.
But knowing him...
He probably
doesn't want to.
Talk to him.
I'm sure you can
persuade him to
let you go home.
Eventually, some
mean human will
fall down here...
And I'll take
THEIR soul instead.
That makes sense,
right?
Fuhuhu.
Oh, and if you
DO hurt ASGORE...
I'll take the
human souls...
Cross the barrier...
And beat the
hell out of you!
That's what friends
are for, right?
Fuhuhu!
Now let's get the
hell out of this
flaming house!
Hurt?
It's nothing.
Next time, listen
when I tell you
to leave, okay?
I'll take care of
this!
Get out of here!
... heh...
"It's nothing"...
No... s-somehow,
with just one
hit...
I'm already...
Already...
D... damn it....
Papyrus...
Alphys...
ASGORE...
Just like that,
I...
I've failed you.
No...
My body...
It feels like it's
splitting apart.
Like any instant...
I'll scatter into
a million pieces.
But...
Deep, deep in my
soul.
There's a burning
feeling I can't
describe.
A burning feeling
that WON'T let me
die.
This isn't just
about monsters
anymore, is it?
If you get past
me, you'll...
You'll destroy them
all, won't you?
Monsters...
Humans...
Everyone...
Everyone's hopes.
Everyone's dreams.
Vanquished in an
instant.
But I WON'T let
you do that.
Right now, everyone
in the world...
I can feel their
hearts beating as
one.
And we all have
ONE goal.
To defeat YOU.
Human.
No, WHATEVER you
are.
For the sake of
the whole world...
I, UNDYNE, will
strike you down!
All
humans
will
die!
You're
our
real
enemy.
Mercy
is for
the
weak.
Well, some humans
are OK, I guess!
Stir harder!
HARDER!
HARDER!!!!
Ugh, let me do it!
Left? You fool!
THIS BURNER ONLY
  GOES ONE WAY!!!
Hotter!
HOTTER, DARNIT!
HOTTER!!!!!!!
Wait, that's too - 
See!?
This is how you -
... are you...
Hitting on me????
????????????????
The sugar is for
  tea, mmm'kay?
Oh, soda?
Actually, even though
  you pointed to it,
  you don't look happy.
Heh, that's fine!
I think soda's gross,
  too!
It rots your teeth...
It rots your mind...
IT ROTS YOUR FIGHTING
  SPIRIT!
... huh?
Why do I have it?
...
What?
You wanna throw the
  spear at it?
Oh, you want some
  hot chocolate?
Wait, wait, I just
  remembered...
That container's empty.
I stopped getting
  it because it was
  always a hassle...
ASGORE kept getting
  marshmallows stuck in
  his beard.
That container's empty.
... tea, huh?
Coming right up!
The fridge!?
You want to have
  the entire fridge!?
No!
Believe me, I would
  GLADLY give you your
  fill of swords.
If you weren't my
  beloved houseguest!
Uhhh... thanks.
I'll, uh, put it
  with the others.
So are we ready
  to start?
CHALLENGE!?
What!?
Papyrus!
Wait a second...!
Darnit!
He thinks I can't
  be friends with
  YOU!?
Fuhuhu!
What a joke!
I could make friends
  with a wimpy loser
  like you any day!
I'll show him!
Listen up, human.
We're not just
  going to be
  friends.
We're going to
  be...
BESTIES.
I'll make you
  like me so much...
You won't be able
  to think of anyone
  else!!!
Fuhuhuhu!
It's the PERFECT
  REVENGE!!
Oh, leaving so soon?
No.
No you're not.
Comfortable?
I'll get you
  something to drink.
All set!
What would you like?
HEY!!!
DON'T GET UP!!!
YOU'RE THE GUEST!!
SIT DOWN AND ENJOY
  YOURSELF!!!
Um, why not just
  point to what you
  want?
You can use the
  spear!
Y'know, I was a
  pretty hotheaded
  kid.
Once, to prove I was
  the strongest, I tried
  to fight ASGORE.
Emphasis on TRIED.
I couldn't land
  a single blow
  on him!
And worse, the whole
  time, he refused
  to fight back!
I was so
  humiliated...
Afterwards, he
  apologized and said
  something goofy...
"Excuse me, do you
  want to know how
  to beat me?"
I said yes, and
  from then on, he
  trained me.
One day, during
  practice, I finally
  knocked him down.
I felt... bad.
But he was
  beaming...
I had never seen
  someone more proud to
  get their butt kicked.
... oh!
I almost forgot
  about your tea!
Just a moment!
Wait a second.
Papyrus...
His cooking lesson...
HE WAS SUPPOSED
  TO HAVE THAT RIGHT
  NOW!!!
And if HE's not
  here to have it...
YOU'LL HAVE TO
  HAVE IT FOR HIM!!!
That's right!!!
NOTHING has brought
  Papyrus and I
  closer than cooking!
Which means that if
  I give you his
  lesson...
WE'LL BECOME CLOSER
  THAN YOU CAN
  EVER IMAGINE!!!
Fuhuhu!!! Afraid!?
We're gonna be best
  friends!!!
Ready!?
It's spaghetti time!
Let's start with the
  sauce!!
Uhh, we'll just scrape
  this into a bowl
  later.
But for NOW!
Alright!
Now it's time
  to stir the pasta!
As a general rule
  of thumb, the more
  you stir...
THE BETTER IT IS!
Ready?
Let's do it!
Fuhuhuhu!
That's the stuff!
Alright, now for
  the final step:
TURN UP THE HEAT!
Let the stovetop
  symbolize your
  passion!
Let your hopes and
  dreams turn into
  burning fire!
READY?
Don't hold anything
  back!!!
Ah.
Man, no wonder
  Papyrus sucks at
  cooking.
So what's next?
Scrapbooking?
Friendship bracelets?
... oh, who am I
  kidding.
I really screwed this
  up, didn't I?
I can't force you to
  like me, human.
Some people just
  don't get along
  with each other.
I understand if
  you feel that
  way about me.
And if we can't
  be friends...
That's okay.
Because...
If we're not
  friends...
IT MEANS I CAN
  DESTROY YOU WITHOUT
  REGRET!
It'll take a moment
  for the water to
  boil.
Okay, it's all
  done!
Here we are.
Careful, it's hot.
It's not THAT hot!!
Just drink it already!
It's pretty good,
  right?
Nothing but the best
  for my ABSOLUTELY
  PRECIOUS FRIEND!!
Hey...
You know...
It's kind of strange
  you chose THAT tea.
Golden flower tea...
That's ASGORE's
  favorite kind.
Actually, now that
  I think about it...
You kind of remind
  me of him.
You're both TOTAL
  weenies!!!
... sort of.
Anyway, long story
  short, he kept training
  me...
And now I'm the
  head of the Royal
  Guard!
So I'm the one
  who gets to train
  dorks to fight!
... like, uh, Papyrus.
But, um, to be
  honest...
*... I don't know if...
I can ever let
  Papyrus into the
  Royal Guard.
Don't tell him I
  said that!
He's just...
Well...
I mean, it's not
  that he's weak.
He's actually
  pretty freaking
  tough!
It's just that...
He's...
He's too innocent
  and nice!!!
I mean, look, he
  was SUPPOSED to
  capture you...
And he ended up
  being FRIENDS with
  you instead!
I could NEVER send
  him into battle!
He'd get ripped
  into little smiling
  shreds.
That's part of why...
I started teaching
  him how to cook,
  you know?
So, um, maybe he
  can do something
  else with his life.
Oh, sorry, I was
  talking for so
  long...
You're out of tea,
  aren't you?
I'll get you some
  more.
Hi, Papyrus!
Ready for your extra-
  private, one-on-one
  training?
Hi, I don't think
  we've...
...
Why don't.
You two.
Come in?
Well, that was
  fun, huh?
We'll have to hang
  out again another
  time...!
But, uh, somewhere
  else I guess.
In the meantime,
  I guess I'll go
  hang with Papyrus.
So if you need
  me, drop by Snowdin,
  OK!?
OH!
And if you ever
  need help...
Just give Papyrus a
  ring, ok?
Since we're in the
  same spot, I'll be
  able to talk too!
Well, see ya
  later, punk!!
Well, see ya
  later, punk...
OH!!!
WAIT!!
This is sudden, but...
Can you deliver
  something for me?
Papyrus suggested
  that I ask you.
But he told me when
  I still hated you,
  so...
Uh! Anyway!!!
Here! Just take it!
Well, what are you
  waiting for!?
Go deliver it!!!
Uhhhh...
Oh, yeah...
It's addressed to
  Dr. Alphys.
OK, see you!!
Can you...
Hey, wait!
Your inventory's
  full.
Uh, well, I'll be
  at Papyrus's.
Come see me when
  you have less
  stuff!
That's it, then...!
No more running away!
I KNEW you would
  come back here!
HERE I COME!!!!!!!
Seven human souls, and
  King ASGORE will become
  a god.
Six.
That's how many we have
  collected thus far.
Understand?
Through your seventh and
  final soul, this world will
  be transformed.
First, however, as is customary
  for those who make it this
  far...
I shall tell you the tragic
  tale of our people.
It all started, long ago...
No, you know what?
SCREW IT!
WHY SHOULD I TELL THAT STORY 
WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE!?! 
NGAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
YOU!
You're standing in
  the way of everybody's
  hopes and dreams!
Alphys's history books
  made me think
  humans were cool...
... with their giant
  robots and flowery
  swordswomen.
BUT YOU?
You're just a coward!
Hiding behind that kid
  so you could run away
  from me again!
You abandoned your
  friend just so you
  could run away!
And let's not forget
  your wimpy goody-two-
  shoes-schtick!
Oooh! I'm making such a
  difference by hugging
  random strangers!
You know what would
  be more valuable
  to everyone?
IF YOU WERE DEAD!!!
That's right, human!
Your continued
  existence is a crime!
Your life is all
  that stands between
  us and our freedom!
Right now, I can
  feel everyone's hearts
  pounding together!
Everyone's been
  waiting their whole
  lives for this moment!
But we're not
  nervous at all.
When everyone puts
  their hearts together,
  they can't lose!
Now, human!
Let's end this,
  right here, right now.
I'll show you how
  determined monsters
  can be!
Step forward when
  you're ready!
Fuhuhuhu!
And! And!
*... and something's
  been bothering me,
  too.
The whole time I was
  chasing after you...
I felt something...
Strange.
The echoes of something
  warm, something...
Something like "I miss
  being friends with you."
BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
I WOULD NEVER GET
  CHUMMY WITH A COWARD
  LIKE YOU!
You!
You must have been
  mind-controlling me!
Manipulating people to
  make them like you...
What a Grade-A FREAK!
Now enough!
For everyone's hopes!
For everyone's dreams!
And for my own
  freaking dignity!
I, UNDYNE, will
  knock you down!
Alphys's history books
  made me think humans
  were compassionate...
You're just a
  remorseless criminal!
You wander through the
  caverns, attacking
  anyone in your path.
Self-defense?
Please.
You didn't kill them
  because you had to.
You killed them
  because it was
  easy for you.
Because it was fun
  for you.
Do you think it
  was fun when I
  found out...?
Do you think it's
  fun when people's
  family members...
... never come home?
Is that fun?
Shyren, who was
  just learning to
  sing...
... was dead, because
  of the whims of
  a single human?
A teenage comedian
  who fell in with
  the wrong crowd...
Doggo, who always
  made me laugh...
Those two sweet dogs,
  who always took care
  of each other...
... were dead, because
  of the whims of
  a single human?
That big dog, who
  wanted nothing more
  than to play...
Lesser Dog, who
  wanted nothing more
  than affection...
The Snowdin Canine
  Unit had been
  completely decimated.
My troops and friends,
  destroyed...
Is that fun?
No.
But your time's up,
  villain!
You won't hurt anyone
  else.
A knight in shining
  armor has appeared.
And all the pain
  you inflicted on
  the fallen...
Every hope, every
  dream you've turned
  to dust...
She's gonna send
  right back through
  her spear!
NGAHHH!!!
I'll show you how
  determined monsters
  truly are!
Come on!
Step forward and
  let's end this!
Forget it.
Look.
Papyrus didn't come
  to his meeting
  today.
Say what you want
  about him.
He's weird, he's
  naive, he's self-
  absorbed...
But Papyrus has
  NEVER missed a
  meeting.
And no matter what
  time you call him
  on the phone...
Night, day, afternoon,
  morning...
He ALWAYS answers
  within the first
  two rings.
But now he's gone.
And his brother
  isn't around,
  either.
...
What did you do
  to him?
What did you DO
  TO HIM?
Papyrus, who I have
  trained every day...
Even though I KNOW
  he's too goofy to
  ever hurt anyone...
Go ahead.
Prepare however you
  want.
But when you step
  forward...
I will KILL you.
Armor... so... hot...
But I can't...
Give up...
Man, do I have
  to do EVERYTHING?
Papyrus, wait!!!
Yeah! Any longer and
  I would have freaked
  out!
Tell us next time
  you decide to take
  a nap, okay!?
Papyrus, we've been
  over this.
Don't talk back to
  me like that!
Go to your room,
  Papyrus!
Wait!
Don't ACTUALLY go
  to your room!!
Wait a second!!!
Can I help too!?
Hey, punk!
What's up!?
Papyrus, how can you
  stand this cold?
So why don't we
  stand in Grillby's
  instead?
But you don't have
  a stomach!!
Papyrus...
Why do you live
  in an icy wasteland?
Really?
Don't you live in
  a huge house?
Where's your brother
  get the money to
  pay for it...?
So? What are you
  waiting for?
The sooner you get
  it over with, the
  better!
Hey, you sure
  are carrying a
  lot of things.
If someone needed
  to give you a thing,
  they sure couldn't!
What?
You LOST the letter!?
What the HECK!?
How!? Why!?
Ughhh...
This is unbelievable.
I should be really
  disappointed in you.
But, uh, to tell
  you the truth, I'm
  kind of relieved!
While you were gone,
  I actually wrote
  a WAY BETTER letter!
And this time, you
  WON'T lose it!!!
I guarantee it!!!
Hey, I have something
  to give you...
But you're carrying
  way too much!!!
Um, so, I have a
  favor to ask you.
Uuuuh, I...
I need you to deliver
  this letter.
To Dr. Alphys.
Huh!?
Why don't I do it
  myself...?
... um.
W-well...
I-it's kind of
  personal, but we're
  friends... so...
I'll t-tell you...
Hotland SUUUUCKS!!!
I don't wanna have
  to go over there!!!
So here you go.
Oh, and if you
  read it...
I'll KILL you.
Thanks so much!
You're the best!!
Hey, Alphys!
Alphys!
Do you think we
  can watch something
  with fighting next?
Oh, and then...
Something...
With princesses!?
Or FIGHTING
  princesses!?
Yayyyyy!
Hey Frisk, why don't
  you go say hi to
  Napstablook?
Oh, tell them I
  said hi, too!
Not with THAT
  attitude!
Oh man!!!
We're gonna be
  able to watch
  anime online!?
Hey, don't worry
  about it, ASGORE.
I think everybody's
  tried to kill Frisk
  at least once.
ASGORE!
That's not what I
  meant!
I hate cold food.
So Alphys fixed up
  my fridge so it
  heats up food instead!
Hot Fridge...
The world's greatest
  invention!
This oven is some
  top-of-the-line
  MTT thing.
But, y'know, as much
  as technology
  advances...
Nothing beats food
  home-cooked with
  fire magic.
You wanna see my
  room?
TOO BAD!
No nerds allowed!
... well, maybe some
  nerds...
You're being kind
  of creepy.
I love how, um,
  thoughtful Papyrus
  is...
But what the hell
  am I supposed to do
  with all these bones?
Do you call it
  your COOLSHED!?
That's the only
  one I've ever
  made, dude.
Oh my GOD, I don't
  even wanna KNOW.
What, lemme guess.
Sometimes you cut a
  hot dog into the
  dog food, right?
OH MY GOD! NO!
I WAS JOKING!!!
DON'T DO THIS!!!
One time, Alphys's...
Uh, friend???
Came over here.
All he did was
  lie seductively
  on the piano...
And fed himself
  grapes.
I don't really
  like that guy.
But I admire
  his lifestyle.
What?
I'm not gonna
  serenade you.
I can't believe he
  leapt through the
  window like that.
Normally he NAILS
  the landing.
It's so nice to
  have you over!
Why not take a
  seat at the
  table?
Sit at the freakin'
  table, you little
  nerd.
Oh my god!
The letter's not
  to PAPYRUS!!!
Fine, you want a
  letter!?
I'll give you a
  letter!!!
YOU GET AN "F"!
Friendship!!!
Hey, shrimp!
You look like you get your
  butt kicked a lot!
Why don't you check out
  my new book on fighting
  in the library?
That is...
If you're tough enough to
  love reading books!
GROWL!!
Hey! Don't throw that
  away! Just deliver it!
Ngahhhhhh!!!
ASGORE! Human!!
Nobody fight each
other!!!
Everyone's gonna
make friends, or
else I'll...!!
I'll...
Uh,
yeah...?
Nice to
meet
you!
Hey
ASGORE,
is that
your ex?
Jeez.
That's
rough,
buddy.
Come on, ASGORE!
It's gonna be OK!
There are plenty
of fish in the
sea...
Well.
I think
it's a
good
analogy.
HEY, SHUT UP!!!
Man, the nerve of
that guy!
Right,
Alphys!??
Uh, Alphys?
??????????????
Well??? Uh???
I guess???
If you want to???
Then????
Don't hold anything
back!!!
Hey! Human! If
you got past
ME, you can
do ANYTHING!
So don't worry!
We're with you
all the way!
Undyne (call)
Hey, I know!
Alphys told me...
It goes to Hotland
  to cool down the
  CORE!
Are you kidding!?
Why wouldn't I!?
The brain's the
  biggest muscle of
  all!!!
Hey, I always stay
  there when I come
  to Snowdin!
I used to stay
  at Papyrus's, but...
His couch is like,
  lumpy and jangly?
And his brother
  kept making 100's
  of midnight snacks.
And Papyrus himself
  doesn't???
Know how to sleep?
Yeah, just sleep
  here.
WOAH, if you go,
  you HAVE to try
  the cheese fries.
They're AMAZINGLY
  bad for you!!
Oh, sorry, Papyrus,
  were you saying
  something?
Grease, I...
I...
...
I want you in
  all my food!!!
I couldn't get enough
  books when I was
  a kid.
I tore through all
  sorts of 'em!
I ripped through
  tons of 'em!
I kicked 'em into
  shreds!!!
But now I think
  reading's cool.
Yeah!! This is the
  best room for
  snow-wrestling!!
Well, you know
  what I think?
Snow-wrestling!!
We'll have to play
  sometime!
If you're going to
  Snowdin, I won't
  have much to say.
There's the rub,
  right?
In Snowdin, duh!!!
Hey, I think I
  found something!
It's the rub!!!
This is Papyrus's
  brother's station.
I'm always catching
  him slacking off,
  or sleeping...
But his results are
  JUST good enough
  to not fire him.
Well, except today.
He didn't tell me
  ANYTHING about you.
JUST scraping by
  the bare minimum
  every time...
I guess it's kind
  of impressive...?
God, I was supposed
  to build a puzzle
  for this room...
But I HATE puzzles.
So I just put a
  huge pile of
  rocks upstream.
What???
Don't judge me!!!
My lack of
  creativity's making
  your life easier!
So you found the
  room behind the
  waterfall...
When I feel like
  relaxing, I always
  take a break there.
That means NEVER!!
I HATE RELAXING!!
I LOVE being
  ANGRY and STRESSED
  OUT!!!
Nah, I'm joking.
This is the room
  where I first
  spotted you.
You have NO idea
  how many spears I
  wanted to throw!!!
But, um, that sea-
  grass is under
  scientific protection.
What!!!!!
That's a real thing!
Wait, did you actually
  DO the puzzle!?
You can't just jump
  across!?
You can't do the
  jimpity jumpity
  joodle!?
The limpity loppity
  leap!?
Alphys helped measure
  out the mud tiles
  for this puzzle.
It was a lot of work,
  but we got to make
  sand castles after.
We're a good team.
She's great at
  building them...
And I'm great at
  wrecking them!!
There's barely even
  a trace of 'em
  now...
What's better than
  a benchful of
  quiche?
Every day, people
  come here and wish
  to the stars...
I won't let them
  down!!!
I'll make everyone's
  wishes come true!!
I'll make most
  people's wishes
  come true!!!
What, you have a
  wish?
Add it to the pile,
  punk.
Along these walls
  lies our tragic
  history...
Tragically BORING!
Why can't our history
  be COOL ANIMATIONS
  like the humans'!?
Someone at LEAST
  engrave a plaque with
  swords and kissing!!!
Come on, don't act
  like your history's
  not COOL!!
This is where I
  threw all those
  spears at you...
That was fun!!!
Let's do that
  again sometime!!
Come on!
Don't fear the spear!
If it wasn't for
  that grass, I'd
  have kicked your...
Uh, if not for
  that grooty, I'd have
  kicked your booty.
Don't ask me what
  a grooty is!!!
Where are all
  these tables coming
  from?
Hey, here's a
  neat party trick.
Try talking to
  the southern
  wall!
First you have to
  throw a party
  though...
Hey, you should
  make it a costume
  party!
Then Papyrus can
  have someplace he
  seems normal!!!
Oh!
I should invite
  Alphys, too!
Ugh, ice cream!?
Sugary... COLD...
Talk about GROSS.
Now this chilly
  pink stuff that
  Alphys makes me...
THAT rules!!!
I'll also drink it
  if it's heated up.
There's normally a
  pair of old shoes
  in that seagrass.
Strangely, they're made
  for someone without
  fins or claws.
What kind of monster
  is like that...?
Oh, wait!?
What about a slime
  monster!?
Wait, those don't
  have feet at all!
Well, if they fit
  you, you might as
  well take them.
Whoever wore them
  isn't coming back!
That bird will carry
  anyone past the gap.
It NEVER says no.
When I was younger,
  it gave me a lift.
It took an hour...
But this bird NEVER
  once thought of
  giving up!!!
Cherish this bird.
Well???
Are you CHERISHING???
CHERISH HARDER!!!
Onion...?
...?
Oh yeah, Shyren
  lives around here.
I used to give her
  piano lessons.
She was really
  talented... for someone
  with no fingers.
One day, she stopped
  coming to her lessons,
  though...
How did her song
  go again...?
Yeah!! YEAH!!!
I made this puzzle!!
Really, it was just
  an excuse to put
  a piano here.
I love FIGHTING THE
  IVORIES!!!
Maybe I'll play you
  something sometime!
Huh!?
Did you solve the
  puzzle!?
No one has ever...
I've been waiting so
  long for someone to...
I mean, uhhh, big deal!
Whatever!
Guess I've gotta
  find a new mystic
  artifact.
That statue's been
  here forever...
No one knows where
  it came from.
Hey, you figured out
  how to get the
  music to play...?
Nice, isn't it?
Those umbrellas were
  ASGORE's idea.
He says he doesn't
  want anyone to
  catch a cold.
Waterfall's underwater
  citizens couldn't care
  less, though.
Did you get a 'brella?
What!?
You're at my
  FAVORITE SPOT!?!?
You'd better jump in
  at least 1000 puddles
  for me!!!
Have you reached
  triple digits yet!?
This whole area's
  like a little
  nature trail.
It's nice to have
  a rainy spot away
  from civilization...
Though, with the city
  filling up, who knows
  how long that'll last.
Well?!
Are you enjoying
  nature!?
ASGORE's castle...
Guess there's no
  stopping you, huh?
The trail dead-ends
  here, unless you can
  jump.
Honestly, I can't
  believe I expected
  you to go this way.
What was I thinking???
... and how was I
  right???
Don't explain it!!
Those flowers...
One day, they just
  started to grow
  there.
I swear, it's like
  they have a mind
  of their own.
That's ridiculous
  though!
That's where I
  met Alphys for the
  first time!!
I was looking for
  cool swords, when
  I saw her...
Uh, standing there,
  staring into the
  abyss.
She looked pretty...
Um...
... contemplative.
So I asked her
  where she thought
  the abyss led to!
She looked up at
  me, shocked, and went
  red in the face.
But I'm scary,
  so I'm used to
  that kinda stuff!
Then she kept
  explaining all her
  different theories.
She went on for
  hours!
I was so captivated!
After that, I kept
  running into her
  here.
And now we're
  friends!
Yeeee hawww!!!
Oh my GOD!
Don't make me tell
  this story AGAIN!!!
The garbage dump!!
So many great things
  come from there!!
The only reason we
  have modern
  technology...
Is 'cause of all the
  human junk that flows
  from the surface!
Plus, it's a GREAT
  place to meet
  girls.
Wait!
Don't quote me on
  that one!!!
I'm right here!
Well, I think we
  should hang out
  with Papyrus.
Huff... puff...!
YEAH!!!
That's MY HOUSE!!!
I ran.
Yep!
Nope!!!
That's my house.
Or, it WAS my
  house, until we
  set it on fire.
But hey, can't say
  I've never done
  that before!!
Hey, if you find
  any cool swords in
  the wreckage...
You know where to
  find me.
That's Napstablook's
  house.
They kind of keep
  to theirself, but...
That's a good ghost.
I try to be a good
  neighbor, but I think
  they're scared of me.
C'mon, what's scary
  about a good-natured
  invite to wrestle!!?
They're incorporeal
  anyway!!!
Oh, you're hanging
  out with Napstablook!?
That's great!!!
I haven't seen them
  hanging out with
  anyone since...
Well, their cousin.
They would both watch
  TV at all hours of
  the day...
Then they would
  practice these
  weird performances.
Where'd they go...?
Don't feel like you
  have to live up
  to their cousin!
Just be your lovable
  old garbage self!
WHAT?
You broke into
  Napstablook's
  cousin's house!?
That's...
That's...!
Hey, what was
  their name, anyway?
Okay, that's
  DEFINITELY wrong.
Seriously, though,
  stop committing
  ghost crimes.
Napstablook's family
  used to run this
  farm, but...
They've all...
Passed on...
... to different jobs,
  since there's not
  much business here.
Them and their cousin
  stayed behind to run
  the family farm.
But no one's seen
  their cousin for a
  long time.
Now Napstablook's
  all alone...
Be nice to them,
  okay!?
Cherish this ghost!!!
Hey!
That's the store of
  Gerson, the Hammer of
  Justice!
The toughest monster
  that ever lived...!
He fought in the
  war between humans
  and monsters...
And he survived!
He's a real hero!
Are you gonna buy
  something?
That river connects
  to Snowdin and
  Hotland.
If you need to get
  from one place to
  another, jump in!
Look, that's all we
  got for public
  transport, OK!?
So what?
A field of echo
  flowers...
They babble back and
  forth to each other...
... until their words
  become meaningless
  noise.
Creepy, huh?
Stop calling me
  from that creepy
  room!!
Once you get familiar
  with this room...
You don't even need
  to light up the
  mushrooms!
I mean, the path
  to Temmie Village is
  never lit up here.
But why would you
  wanna go there!?
It's down south if
  you want to avoid
  it.
You don't even need
  to light up the
  lanterns!
... yeah.
Whatever.
That's where I first
  talked to you!
Weren't you SUPER
  terrified?
I practice that
  monologue ALL the
  time in the mirror!
I mean!!!
Uh!!!
No I don't!!!
UH!!!
NO!!!
I DON'T!!!!
Do you have a
  monologue for
  EVERYTHING?
Fields of flowers,
  whispering everybody's
  hopes and dreams...
NGAHHHH!!!
IT FILLS ME WITH
  POWER!!!
NGAHHHH!!
This room...!
Error?
That sure was a
  tense scenario.
I just wanted to
  help that poor kid,
  but...
I thought if I tried,
  you'd attack me!
Thankfully, you
  ended up saving
  them.
I'd actually...
Forgotten what had
  happened here.
You just let that
  poor kid drop to
  the floor.
Maybe you were just
  afraid.
But if I hadn't
  been around, then...?
That's when you ran
  away when your friend
  asked for help!!!
Though, who can blame
  you for fleeing from
  certain death...?
ME!!!!
I'm still TOTALLY
  disappointed!
That's the WIMPIEST
  thing you've EVER
  done!
Apologize to your
  poor friend, OK,
  buster!?
Yeah, someone else
  has to care so I
  don't have to!
I worked in an office
  pushing blocks for
  a month!
My respect for block
  puzzles was depleted
  by corporate life.
(I won't tell him
  that's not how it
  works...)
Well, it was more
  of a, uh, community
  service thing.
Uh, yep!
Totally of my own
  volition there!
Oh my GOD!!!
Wasn't this room
  the BEST!?
Like when I decided
  to NOT do that
  BORING monologue...
And then went TOTALLY
  off-the-cuff!?
Or when I almost
  killed you with
  spears???
Or when I almost
  killed you with
  MORE spears???
Aw man.
I should have taken
  photos.
Think about how cute
  a little scrapbook
  would be...
Let's start a photo
  company for boss
  fights!
Relive the memories...
Going off-the-cuff...
It helped that I...
Uh.
Completely forgot the
  words to my monologue,
  anyway...
This is where I
  was chasing you...
But you got a phone
  call, so I had to
  wait.
What!?
What were you even
  calling about!?
As I was trying
  to kill them!?
Nobody starts as
  great friends, huh?
Well, you're gonna
  END as my great
  friend!!
I can't believe
  Papyrus's brother was
  sleeping!!
I was counting on
  him to stop you!!
UrrrrgHHHH!!!
I agree!!
Your brother needs
  to...!
... wait, isn't that
  just called sleeping?
Wait. Papyrus...
When do YOU sleep?
Well, I was just
  thinking...
If you're not using
  that cool car bed,
  can I have it!?
Thank God for that
  water cooler, huh?
Actually, you can
  thank Alphys...
She put it there
  just for me.
Now I can take a
  drink on the way
  to her lab.
Though, usually I'm
  not wearing 100
  pounds of armor...!
Thanks for giving me
  that water, I guess.
You're at Alphys's
  lab?
Is she there...?
Hey, tell her I
  said hi, okay!?
And, tell me how
  she's doing!
And tell me if
  she needs anything,
  and...
Wait! No!
Don't ask any of
  that!!!
But she's fine,
  right!?
What!?
You're in her room!?
Get out of there!
Unless, um, she
  invited you...
No wayyyy!!!
That did NOT happen!
Stop that!
So we'll just have
  to COMBINE OUR
  POWER!!!
Yeah, but it's a
  BIG zero!!!
THE BIGGEST ZERO!
No WAY!!!
Come to Snowdin
  and visit ME!!!
Wrong! I'm standing
  slightly to the
  right!!
Come on!!!
Make your choice!!!
I rode on a
  conveyor belt
  once.
I learned pretty
  fast that they
  make me sick.
Yeah, like 9000
  times!!
It was awesome!!
Steam vents?
I think Alphys told
  me about those.
The CORE cools off
  by releasing steam
  through those...
And at the same
  time, it doubles
  as transport!
Pretty cool, if
  you aren't wearing
  a dress!
Huh!?
Did you put on
  a dress?
What!?
Why'd I call Alphys
  about the weather?
Who CARES!?!?
Isn't it natural
  to love meteorology!?
YEAH!?!!
THERE IS?!!?!
And I'm forecasting
  an incoming front
  of SHUT UP!!!
What!?
What ABOUT this
  room!?
Oh, Papyrus.
I can't stay mad
  at you.
Huh?
Those kids are
  skipping school?
... well, I can't
  blame them, school
  sucks!
We need to find
  some way to make
  it cooler...
Hey, what if I
  visited their
  school!?
Then I could beat
  up ALL the teachers!
Okay, maybe I
  wouldn't beat up
  a teacher...
Really? Careful, that
  dude gives me bad
  vibes.
I don't care about
  people just because
  they're popular.
Pssshhht, what!?
Popular with WHO?
Awww...
Papyrus, you're popular
  with me, too.
Let's not discuss
  this anymore.
What?
I thought he only
  had three stations.
Who the heck keeps
  hiring this guy!?
Seriously!!
Oh MAN, did I ever
  tell you MY conveyor
  puzzle idea?
Imagine four basketball
  hoops on the sides
  of a conveyor loop.
The conveyor keeps
  speeding up, until
  you get sick...
Then you have to
  puke in all four
  hoops in a row!!!
You have to time
  the pukes!!!
Oh man!!!
You wanna hear more
  of my great idea!?
What!?
No, I HATE puzzles!
Papyrus, YOU do it!
Oh my GOD!
NO!
Shut up!!!
NO!!!!
THAT'S EVEN WORSE!!!
Careful, the Royal
  Guard patrols that
  area.
I think it's RG01
  and RG02 today...
It's funny, the bunny
  actually requested to be
  with the dragon guy.
It's nice when people
  are platonic friends
  like that!
Yeah! You totally
  kicked his butt
  on the news!!!
And I bet Alphys
  was helping you,
  wasn't she?
Oh my god!!!
You guys becoming
  friends...
It's kinda cute...
... I mean, uh...
I'm tough!!!
I love to eat rocks!!
What!?!?
...
What!?
No, we just
  became friends!!
You can't already
  be that close...
What?
Hey, did I ever
  tell you about my
  puzzle idea?
It's a maze full
  of steam vents...
But the steam vents
  are on conveyor
  belts, and...
Hey, this reminds
  me of a puzzle
  idea.
Yeah, but I love
  driving you crazy!
Where are all these
  tables coming from?
What would a mouse
  need a table for?
But where's the
  cheese come from!?
doesn't it come
  from milk?
Big deal...
Earlier, the human
  and I danced with
  DEATH!!!
Yeah, she's like
  super hot.
WHAT!?
RG01 and RG02 are
  slacking off?!
Come ON!
They should be KILLING
  you right now!
Not that I want
  them to, I mean.
But they could at
  least TRY, y'know!?
Oh yeah, that
  reminds me.
I told RG01 and RG02
  that if they managed
  to nab you...
I'd take them both
  out for ice cream.
I hope you were able
  to avoid them.
Cause I HATE ice
  cream!!
A hotel?? Cool!!
I've never stayed
  at a fancy hotel!
Papyrus, we should
  go on vacation
  sometime!
Well, maybe we would
  go someplace besides
  the hotel, too...
Woah!!
A fancy restaurant!?
Are you treating us?
Do they have steak?
Well, maybe our cooking
  abilities aren't
  exactly perfect.
Nah!!!
They totally are!!
Eat up, punk!!
Oh?
No pets allowed, huh?
What's the problem?
What's wrong with
  dogs!?
What's WRONG with it!?
So you hate this dog,
  but like weird
  talking flowers?
I mean, if having
  an imaginary friend
  makes you happy...
What's his name.
Oh my GOD!!!
You just made that
  up!!
Heyyy!!
Let's throw a room
  party!
We can order a pizza
  and stay up all night
  playing games!
Nah, like "pillow
  fight the skeleton!"
Aww, okay.
Too late!!!
Nah, why would I
  do that?
I'm saving it for
  the party!!
C'mon, Papyrus.
Think about it.
It stands for
  L-evator, duh!!!
Probably?
It stands for RED,
  'cause that's the
  color of the lights!
Uhhhh...
Light green.
OK, OK.
I've got it.
The L stands for
  the color "Lime."
What!? Limes rule!!
I eat them whole
  all the time!!
Oh my god!
Those aren't LIMES!
Those are CUCUMBERS!
Gross!!
Why did you even
  do that!?
(He doesn't even
  HAVE eyes!!!)
But isn't love
  supposed to be
  FIERY RED!?
Like a cartoony
  human-heart?
You make it sound
  like I give people
  nausea.
Okay, yeah!
That's me!
No WAY!
That makes NO sense.
Cause if you face
  the opposite way,
  they'd be wrong!
Let's not get
  philosophical
  over the alphabet.
Papyrus...
Why are you
  wearing those?
What?
No!
You're Papyrus!
FINE then!
I'm not Undyne!
The name's...
StrongFish91!
Uh, OK.
Yeah, cooking is
  definitely fire-
  elemental!
Would you really
  call it "cooking"
  a popsicle...?
Oh MAN, I almost
  forgot about that!
What a mess!
It took forever to
  hose everything off.
The CORE is a huge
  tower of electric
  energy.
So I don't think
  your phone will
  work through it...
You have something
  you have to do,
  right...?
Well...
Even without words,
  we'll be with you
  in spirit, OK!?
We're counting on
  you, so don't mess
  it up!
We're not going to
  say goodbye to you
  just yet!
Oh! And I want a
  poster for all of
  my big fights!
And a barbeque!
And a second
  barbeque!
Let's do it!
We could use the
  spears as kabob
  skewers!
What's a kabone?
No, ducks have
  webbed feet.
Yeah, haven't you
  seen a duck wrap
  up a loaf of bread?
Then suck all of
  its guts out with
  its fangs?
Yeah. They just take
  'em all out before
  they sell it.
(I thought he knew
  I was joking...)
Papyrus, wait, you
  know I'm joking,
  right...?
Do spiders even
  use the internet?
That's Alphys's house.
Hey, why don't we
  all go over and
  watch anime?
Oh my GOD!!!
Anime isn't just for
  kids! It's deep!
It's EMOTIONAL!!!
YEah CAUSE It'S HoW
  I'M FEElinG RIGHT
  NOW!!!
You don't have to
  say that, Papyrus.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
  SAY THAT, PAPYRUS!!
What!?
Royal Guards are
  blocking the way!?
Then I'll tell them
  to...!
Well, nothing, I
  guess.
I already told them
  to seek out and
  destroy you!
And I can't just
  tell them I've
  changed my mind.
You see, Alphys
  showed me these
  animations about...
Uhhh, humans?
So I can learn
  their weaknesses?
And one of them
  is about this human
  that, uh...
Well, suffice to say,
  they can control
  people's minds!!!
Surprised?
I know your kind's
  hidden power!
Anyway, I told my
  crew that if I ever
  defended a human...
I must be under
  some kind of mind
  control!
And to disregard
  EVERYTHING that I
  tell them!
So, sorry...
But my hands are
  tied.
By the way, that
  animation is
  really good!
I'm not going to
  tell them to let
  you by!
Hey!
What are you up
  to, punk!?
Ngahhhh!
Hey!
Who's in charge
  here!?
Oh... yeah, that's
  right!
I quit my job as
  leader of the Royal
  Guard.
Actually, since we
  won't be fighting
  anymore...
The Royal Guard
  totally disbanded.
There's, uh, only
  one member now.
Yeah!! He is!!!
C'mere!!
Anyways, now I'm
  working as Alphy's
  lab assistant...
We're gonna find a
  way out of this dump
  once and for all!!
Oh, yeah, and I'm a
  gym teacher at the
  queen's new school.
Did you know I can
  bench-press seven
  children!?
Awesome, right?
Hey.
I'm sorry about what
  happened with ASGORE.
You were just doing
  what you had to.
It's not your fault
  he...
Ah, darn it.
I miss the big guy.
...
Come on, Undyne!
Snap out of it!
Uh, I guess I'll
  tell you how Alphys
  is doing.
Well, she's the
  same as ever.
Maybe a little more
  reclusive than
  normal.
Seems like something's
  really bothering
  her...
But she can get
  through it!
I'm there supporting
  her!!
That's what friends
  are for, right?
Hey, where-ever you
  are...
I hope it's better
  than here.
It took a lot of
  sacrifice for you
  to get there...
So, where-ever you
  are...
You have to try to
  be happy, okay!?
For our sakes!
We'll feel better
  knowing our trouble
  was worth it.
We're all with you!
Everyone is!
Even the queen!
HEYYY!
WAIT a second!
TORIEL!
TORIEL!
Do you wanna...?
Heh, she says
  she's busy.
But call back any
  time, ok?!
She'd love to talk!
See ya, punk!
I'm fine.
Why don't you talk
  for a while?
Oh, she SAYS she's
  busy.
Yeah!
She'd be happy to
  hear from ya!
See ya, punk!
Hey...!
Uh, this is
  Undyne...
(Shut up, Papyrus!)
(This was YOUR idea!)
HUMAN!
You have to deliver
  something for me!
Uh, please?
I'm at Snowdin
  in front of
  Papyrus's.
See ya, punk!
Undyne and Frisk
IS THAT IT? 
 
  Yes         No
Right???
              NEVER 
  Yes         with you
RIGHT?
 
  True        False
Undyne the Undying
Damn it...
So even THAT
power...
It wasn't enough...?
Heh...
Heheheh...
If you...
If you think I'm
gonna give up hope,
you're wrong.
'Cause I've...
Got my friends
behind me.
Alphys told me that
she would watch me
fight you...
And if anything went
wrong, she would...
evacuate everyone.
By now she's called
ASGORE and told him
to absorb the 6
human SOULs.
And with that
power...
This world will
live on...!
You're gonna have
to try a little
harder than THAT.
You...
You're gonna have
to try a little
harder than THAT!

It's still a

That skeleton over there

What did he say...?
Something like...
"Traffic lights have three
  lights on them."
"The third light, the green
  one, means GO."
"The first light, the red
  one, means STOP."
"The second light, the yellow
  one, means YIELD."
"In order to dodge an
  orange attack, you must
  be moving."
"So, just think of it
  this way..."
"Red and yellow lights together
  make orange."
"Then you obey the rule
  of the leftover green
  light, which means GO."
"Easy, huh?"
"Just think of a red and yellow
  traffic light which is
  actually green."
Yeah...

Why do I look like a weird
  black sausage?
Just the angle.
As a youth, I would sneak
  out to play by this creepy
  flaming pit.
Since the CORE is always
  re-arranging, it was like
  a game trying to find it.
Now it is my special place.
It is nice for cooking s'mores
  and things like that.
We were hired by Mettaton
  to destroy you.
But since he never paid us,
  we all decided to quit.
No hard feelings.
Why do I look like a black
  sausage and not a knight
  or a wizard?
Well...

I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.

I was also still doing my job, on a new contract, and hoping Dr. Volescu and Dr. Bharadwaj finished their survey soon so we could get back to the habitat and I could watch episode 397 of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.

I admit I was distracted. It was a boring contract so far and I was thinking about backburnering the status alert channel and trying to access music on the entertainment feed without HubSystem logging the extra activity. It was trickier to do it in the field than it was in the habitat.

This assessment zone was a barren stretch of coastal island, with low, flat hills rising and falling and thick greenish-black grass up to my ankles, not much in the way of flora or fauna, except a bunch of different-sized birdlike things and some puffy floaty things that were harmless as far as we knew. The coast was dotted with big bare craters, one of which Bharadwaj and Volescu were taking samples in. The planet had a ring, which from our current position dominated the horizon when you looked out to sea. I was looking at the sky and mentally poking at the feed when the bottom of the crater exploded.

I didn’t bother to make a verbal emergency call. I sent the visual feed from my field camera to Dr. Mensah’s, and jumped down into the crater. As I scrambled down the sandy slope, I could already hear Mensah over the emergency comm channel, yelling at someone to get the hopper in the air now. They were about ten kilos away, working on another part of the island, so there was no way they were going to get here in time to help.

Conflicting commands filled my feed but I didn’t pay attention. Even if I hadn’t borked my own governor module, the emergency feed took priority, and it was chaotic, too, with the automated HubSystem wanting data and trying to send me data I didn’t need yet and Mensah sending me telemetry from the hopper. Which I also didn’t need, but it was easier to ignore than HubSystem simultaneously demanding answers and trying to supply them.

In the middle of all that, I hit the bottom of the crater. I have small energy weapons built into both arms, but the one I went for was the big projectile weapon clamped to my back. The hostile that had just exploded up out of the ground had a really big mouth, so I felt I needed a really big gun.

I dragged Bharadwaj out of its mouth and shoved myself in there instead, and discharged my weapon down its throat and then up toward where I hoped the brain would be. I’m not sure if that all happened in that order; I’d have to replay my own field camera feed. All I knew was that I had Bharadwaj, and it didn’t, and it had disappeared back down the tunnel.

She was unconscious and bleeding through her suit from massive wounds in her right leg and side. I clamped the weapon back into its harness so I could lift her with both arms. I had lost the armor on my left arm and a lot of the flesh underneath, but my nonorganic parts were still working. Another burst of commands from the governor module came through and I backburnered it without bothering to decode them. Bharadwaj, not having nonorganic parts and not as easily repaired as me, was definitely a priority here and I was mainly interested in what the MedSystem was trying to tell me on the emergency feed. But first I needed to get her out of the crater.

During all this, Volescu was huddled on the churned up rock, losing his shit, not that I was unsympathetic. I was far less vulnerable in this situation than he was and I wasn’t exactly having a great time either. I said, “Dr. Volescu, you need to come with me now.”

He didn’t respond. MedSystem was advising a tranq shot and blah blah blah, but I was clamping one arm on Dr. Bharadwaj’s suit to keep her from bleeding out and supporting her head with the other, and despite everything I only have two hands. I told my helmet to retract so he could see my human face. If the hostile came back and bit me again, this would be a bad mistake, because I did need the organic parts of my head. I made my voice firm and warm and gentle, and said, “Dr. Volescu, it’s gonna be fine, okay? But you need to get up and come help me get her out of here.”

That did it. He shoved to his feet and staggered over to me, still shaking. I turned my good side toward him and said, “Grab my arm, okay? Hold on.”

He managed to loop his arm around the crook of my elbow and I started up the crater towing him, holding Bharadwaj against my chest. Her breathing was rough and desperate and I couldn’t get any info from her suit. Mine was torn across my chest so I upped the warmth on my body, hoping it would help. The feed was quiet now, Mensah having managed to use her leadership priority to mute everything but MedSystem and the hopper, and all I could hear on the hopper feed was the others frantically shushing each other.

The footing on the side of the crater was lousy, soft sand and loose pebbles, but my legs weren’t damaged and I got up to the top with both humans still alive. Volescu tried to collapse and I coaxed him away from the edge a few meters, just in case whatever was down there had a longer reach than it looked.

I didn’t want to put Bharadwaj down because something in my abdomen was severely damaged and I wasn’t sure I could pick her up again. I ran my field camera back a little and saw I had gotten stabbed with a tooth, or maybe a cilia. Did I mean a cilia or was that something else? They don’t give murderbots decent education modules on anything except murdering, and even those are the cheap versions. I was looking it up in HubSystem’s language center when the little hopper landed nearby. I let my helmet seal and go opaque as it settled on the grass.

We had two standard hoppers: a big one for emergencies and this little one for getting to the assessment locations. It had three compartments: one big one in the middle for the human crew and two smaller ones to each side for cargo, supplies, and me. Mensah was at the controls. I started walking, slower than I normally would have because I didn’t want to lose Volescu. As the ramp started to drop, Pin-Lee and Arada jumped out and I switched to voice comm to say, “Dr. Mensah, I can’t let go of her suit.”

It took her a second to realize what I meant. She said hurriedly, “That’s all right, bring her up into the crew cabin.”

Murderbots aren’t allowed to ride with the humans and I had to have verbal permission to enter. With my cracked governor there was nothing to stop me, but not letting anybody, especially the people who held my contract, know that I was a free agent was kind of important. Like, not having my organic components destroyed and the rest of me cut up for parts important.

I carried Bharadwaj up the ramp into the cabin, where Overse and Ratthi were frantically unclipping seats to make room. They had their helmets off and their suit hoods pulled back, so I got to see their horrified expressions when they took in what was left of my upper body through my torn suit. I was glad I had sealed my helmet.

This is why I actually like riding with the cargo. Humans and augmented humans in close quarters with murderbots is too awkward. At least, it’s awkward for this murderbot. I sat down on the deck with Bharadwaj in my lap while Pin-Lee and Arada dragged Volescu inside.

We left two pacs of field equipment and a couple of instruments behind, still sitting on the grass where Bharadwaj and Volescu had been working before they went down to the crater for samples. Normally I’d help carry them, but MedSystem, which was monitoring Bharadwaj through what was left of her suit, was pretty clear that letting go of her would be a bad idea. But no one mentioned the equipment. Leaving easily replaceable items behind may seem obvious in an emergency, but I had been on contracts where the clients would have told me to put the bleeding human down to go get the stuff. 

On this contract, Dr. Ratthi jumped up and said, “I’ll get the cases!”

I yelled, “No!” which I’m not supposed to do; I’m always supposed to speak respectfully to the clients, even when they’re about to accidentally commit suicide. HubSystem could log it and it could trigger punishment through the governor module. If it wasn’t hacked.

Fortunately, the rest of the humans yelled “No!” at the same time, and Pin-Lee added, “For fuck’s sake, Ratthi!”

Ratthi said, “Oh, no time, of course. I’m sorry!” and hit the quick-close sequence on the hatch.

So we didn’t lose our ramp when the hostile came up under it, big mouth full of teeth or cilia or whatever chewing right through the ground. There was a great view of it on the hopper’s cameras, which its system helpfully sent straight to everybody’s feed. The humans screamed.

Mensah pushed us up into the air so fast and hard I nearly leaned over, and everybody who wasn’t on the floor ended up there.

In the quiet afterward, as they gasped with relief, Pin-Lee said, “Ratthi, if you get yourself killed—”

“You’ll be very cross with me, I know.” Ratthi slid down the wall a little more and waved weakly at her.

“That’s an order, Ratthi, don’t get yourself killed,” Mensah said from the pilot’s seat. She sounded calm, but I have security priority, and I could see her racing heartbeat through MedSystem.

Arada pulled out the emergency medical kit so they could stop the bleeding and try to stabilize Bharadwaj. I tried to be as much like an appliance as possible, clamping the wounds where they told me to, using my failing body temperature to try to keep her warm, and keeping my head down so I couldn’t see them staring at me.

PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY AT 60% AND DROPPING

Our habitat is a pretty standard model, seven interconnected domes set down on a relatively flat plain above a narrow river valley, with our power and recycling system connected on one side. We had an environmental system, but no air locks, as the planet’s atmosphere was breathable, just not particularly good for humans for the long term. I don’t know why, because it’s one of those things I’m not contractually obligated to care about.

We picked the location because it’s right in the middle of the assessment area, and while there are trees scattered through the plain, each one is fifteen or so meters tall, very skinny, with a single layer of spreading canopy, so it’s hard for anything approaching to use them as cover. Of course, that didn’t take into account anything approaching via tunnel.

We have security doors on the habitat for safety but HubSystem told me the main one was already open as the hopper landed. Dr. Gurathin had a lift gurney ready and guided it out to us. Overse and Arada had managed to get Bharadwaj stabilized, so I was able to put her down on it and follow the others into the habitat.

The humans headed for Medical and I stopped to send the little hopper commands to lock and seal itself, then I locked the outer doors. Through the security feed, I told the drones to widen our perimeter so I’d have more warning if something big came at us. I also set some monitors on the seismic sensors to alert me to anomalies just in case the hypothetical something big decided to tunnel in.

After I secured the habitat, I went back to what was called the security ready room, which was where weapons, ammo, perimeter alarms, drones, and all the other supplies pertaining to security were stored, including me. I shed what was left of the armor and on MedSystem’s advice sprayed wound sealant all over my bad side. I wasn’t dripping with blood, because my arteries and veins seal automatically, but it wasn’t nice to look at. And it hurt, though the wound seal did numb it a little. I had already set an eight-hour security interdiction through HubSystem, so nobody could go outside without me, and then set myself as off-duty. I checked the main feed but no one was filing any objections to that.

I was freezing because my temperature controls had given out at some point on the way here, and the protective skin that went under my armor was in pieces. I had a couple of spares but pulling one on right now would not be practical, or easy. The only other clothing I had was a uniform I hadn’t worn yet, and I didn’t think I could get it on, either. (I hadn’t needed the uniform because I hadn’t been patrolling inside the habitat. Nobody had asked for that, because with only eight of them and all friends, it would be a stupid waste of resources, namely me.) I dug around one-handed in the storage case until I found the extra human-rated medical kit I’m allowed in case of emergencies, and opened it and got the survival blanket out. I wrapped up in it, then climbed into the plastic bed of my cubicle. I let the door seal as the white light flickered on.

It wasn’t much warmer in there, but at least it was cozy. I connected myself to the resupply and repair leads, leaned back against the wall and shivered. MedSystem helpfully informed me that my performance reliability was now at 58 percent and dropping, which was not a surprise. I could definitely repair in eight hours, and probably mostly regrow my damaged organic components, but at 58 percent, I doubted I could get any analysis done in the meantime. So I set all the security feeds to alert me if anything tried to eat the habitat and started to call up the supply of media I’d downloaded from the entertainment feed. I hurt too much to pay attention to anything with a story, but the friendly noise would keep me company.

Then someone knocked on the cubicle door.

I stared at it and lost track of all my neatly arrayed inputs. Like an idiot, I said, “Uh, yes?”

Dr. Mensah opened the door and peered in at me. I’m not good at guessing actual humans’ ages, even with all the visual entertainment I watch. People in the shows don’t usually look much like people in real life, at least not in the good shows. She had dark brown skin and lighter brown hair, cut very short, and I’m guessing she wasn’t young or she wouldn’t be in charge. She said, “Are you all right? I saw your status report.”

“Uh.” That was the point where I realized that I should have just not answered and pretended to be in stasis. I pulled the blanket around my chest, hoping she hadn’t seen any of the missing chunks. Without the armor holding me together, it was much worse. “Fine.”

So, I’m awkward with actual humans. It’s not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it’s not them; it’s me. I know I’m a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous. Also, if I’m not in the armor then it’s because I’m wounded and one of my organic parts may fall off and plop on the floor at any moment and no one wants to see that.

“Fine?” She frowned. “The report said you lost 20 percent of your body mass.”

“It’ll grow back,” I said. I know to an actual human I probably looked like I was dying. My injuries were the equivalent of a human losing a limb or two plus most of their blood volume.

“I know, but still.” She eyed me for a long moment, so long I tapped the security feed for the mess, where the non-wounded members of the group were sitting around the table talking. They were discussing the possibility of more underground fauna and wishing they had intoxicants. That seemed pretty normal. She continued, “You were very good with Dr. Volescu. I don’t think the others realized . . . They were very impressed.” 

“It’s part of the emergency med instructions, calming victims.” I tugged the blanket tighter so she didn’t see anything awful. I could feel something lower down leaking.

“Yes, but the MedSystem was prioritizing Bharadwaj and didn’t check Volescu’s vital signs. It didn’t take into account the shock of the event, and it expected him to be able to leave the scene on his own.”

On the feed it was clear that the others had reviewed Volescu’s field camera video. They were saying things like I didn’t even know it had a face. I’d been in armor since we arrived, and I hadn’t unsealed the helmet when I was around them. There was no specific reason. The only part of me they would have seen was my head, and it’s standard, generic human. But they didn’t want to talk to me and I definitely didn’t want to talk to them; on duty it would distract me and off duty . . . I didn’t want to talk to them. Mensah had seen me when she signed the rental contract. But she had barely looked at me and I had barely looked at her because again, murderbot + actual human = awkwardness. Keeping the armor on all the time cuts down on unnecessary interaction.

I said, “It’s part of my job, not to listen to the System feeds when they . . . make mistakes.” That’s why you need constructs, SecUnits with organic components. But she should know that. Before she accepted delivery of me, she had logged about ten protests, trying to get out of having to have me. I didn’t hold it against her. I wouldn’t have wanted me either.

Seriously, I don’t know why I didn’t just say you’re welcome and please get out of my cubicle so I can sit here and leak in peace.

“All right,” she said, and looked at me for what objectively I knew was 2.4 seconds and subjectively about twenty excruciating minutes. “I’ll see you in eight hours. If you need anything before then, please send me an alert on the feed.” She stepped back and let the door slide closed.

It left me wondering what they were all marveling at so I called up the recording of the incident. Okay, wow. I had talked to Volescu all the way up the side of the crater. I had been mostly concerned with the hopper’s trajectory and Bharadwaj not bleeding out and what might come out of that crater for a second try; I hadn’t been listening to myself, basically. I had asked him if he had kids. It was boggling. Maybe I had been watching too much media. (He did have kids. He was in a four-way marriage and had seven, all back home with his partners.)

All my levels were too elevated now for a rest period, so I decided I might as well get some use out of it and look at the other recordings. Then I found something weird. There was an “abort” order in the HubSystem command feed, the one that controlled, or currently believed it controlled, my governor module. It had to be a glitch. It didn’t matter, because when MedSystem has priority—

PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY AT 39%...

STASIS INITIATED FOR EMERGENCY REPAIR SEQUENCE

When I woke up, I was mostly all there again, and up to 80 percent efficiency and climbing. I checked all the feeds immediately, in case the humans wanted to go out, but Mensah had extended the security interdict on the habitat for another four hours. Which was a relief, since it would give me time to get back up to the 98 percent range. But there was also a notice for me to report to her. That had never happened before. But maybe she wanted to go over the hazard info package and figure out why it hadn’t warned us about the underground hostile. I was wondering a little about that myself.

Their group was called PreservationAux and it had bought an option on this planet’s resources, and the survey trip was to see if it was worth bidding on a full share. Knowing about things on the planet that might eat them while they’re trying to do whatever it is they’re doing was kind of important.

I don’t care much about who my clients are or what they’re trying to accomplish. I knew this group was from a freehold planet but I hadn’t bothered to look up the specifics. Freehold meant it had been terraformed and colonized but wasn’t affiliated with any corporate confederations. Basically freehold generally meant shitshow so I hadn’t been expecting much from them. But they were surprisingly easy to work for.

I cleaned all the stray fluids off my new skin, then climbed out of the cubicle. That was when I realized I hadn’t put the pieces of my armor up and it was all over the floor, covered with my fluids and Bharadwaj’s blood. No wonder Mensah had looked into the cubicle; she had probably thought I was dead in there. I put it all back into its slots in the reclaimer for repair.

I had an alternate set, but it was still packed into storage and it would take extra time to pull it out and do the diagnostics and the fitting. I hesitated over the uniform, but the security feed would have notified Mensah that I was awake, so I needed to get out there.

It was based on a standard research group’s uniforms, and meant to be comfortable inside the habitat: knit gray pants, long-sleeved T-shirt, and a jacket, like the exercise clothes humans and augmented humans wore, plus soft shoes. I put it on, tugged the sleeves down over the gunports on my forearms, and went out into the habitat.

I went through two interior secure doors to the crew area, and found them in the main hub in a huddle around a console, looking at one of the hovering displays. They were all there except Bharadwaj, who was still in the infirmary, and Volescu, who was sitting in there with her. There were mugs and empty meal packets on some of the consoles. I’m not cleaning that up unless I’m given a direct order.

Mensah was busy so I stood and waited.

Ratthi glanced at me, and then did a startled double take. I had no idea how to react. This is why I prefer wearing the armor, even inside the habitat where it’s unnecessary and can just get in the way. Human clients usually like to pretend I’m a robot and that’s much easier in the armor. I let my eyes unfocus and pretended I was running a diagnostic on something.

Clearly bewildered, Ratthi said, “Who is this?”

They all turned to look at me. All but Mensah, who was sitting at the console with the interface pressed to her forehead. It was clear that even after seeing my face on Volescu’s camera video, they didn’t recognize me without the helmet. So then I had to look at them and say, “I’m your SecUnit.”

They all looked startled and uncomfortable. Almost as uncomfortable as I did. I wished I’d waited to pull the spare armor out.

Part of it is, they didn’t want me here. Not here in their hub, but here on the planet. One of the reasons the bond company requires it, besides slapping more expensive markups on their clients, is that I was recording all their conversations all the time, though I wasn’t monitoring anything I didn’t need to do a half-assed version of my job. But the company would access all those recordings and data mine them for anything they could sell. No, they don’t tell people that. Yes, everyone does know it. No, there’s nothing you can do about it.

After a subjective half hour and an objective 3.4 seconds, Dr. Mensah turned, saw me, and lowered the interface. She said, “We were checking the hazard report for this region to try to learn why that thing wasn’t listed under hazardous fauna. Pin-Lee thinks the data has been altered. Can you examine the report for us?”

“Yes, Dr. Mensah.” I could have done this in my cubicle and we could have all saved the embarrassment. Anyway, I picked up the feed she was watching from HubSystem and started to check the report. 

It was basically a long list of pertinent info and warnings on the planet and specifically the area where our habitat was, with emphasis on weather, terrain, flora, fauna, air quality, mineral deposits, possible hazards related to any and all of those, with connections to subreports with more detailed information. Dr. Gurathin, the least talkative one, was an augmented human and had his own implanted interface. I could feel him poking around in the data, while the others, using the touch interfaces, were just distant ghosts. I had a lot more processing power than he did, though.

I thought they were being paranoid; even with the interfaces you actually have to read the words, preferably all the words. Sometimes non-augmented humans don’t do that. Sometimes augmented humans don’t do it either.

But as I checked the general warning section, I noticed something was odd about the formatting. A quick comparison with the other parts of the report told me that yeah, something had been removed, a connection to a subreport broken. “You’re right,” I said, distracted as I rifled through data storage looking for the missing piece. I couldn’t find it; it wasn’t just a broken connection, somebody had actually deleted the subreport. That was supposed to be impossible with this type of planetary survey package, but I guess it wasn’t as impossible as all that. “Something’s been deleted from the warnings and the section on fauna.”

The reaction to that in general was pretty pissed off. There were some loud complaints from Pin-Lee and Overse and dramatic throwing-hands-in-the-air from Ratthi. But, like I said, they were all friends and a lot less restrained with each other than my last set of contractual obligations. It was why, if I forced myself to admit it, I had actually been enjoying this contract, up until something tried to eat me and Bharadwaj.

SecSystem records everything, even inside the sleeping cabins, and I see everything. That’s why it’s easier to pretend I’m a robot. Overse and Arada were a couple, but from the way they acted they’d always been one, and they were best friends with Ratthi. Ratthi had an unrequited thing for Pin-Lee, but didn’t act stupid about it. Pin-Lee was exasperated a lot, and tossed things around when the others weren’t there, but it wasn’t about Ratthi. I thought that being under the company’s eye affected her more than the others. Volescu admired Mensah to the point where he might have a crush on her. Pin-Lee did, too, but she and Bharadwaj flirted occasionally in an old comfortable way that suggested it had been going on for a long time. Gurathin was the only loner, but he seemed to like being with the others. He had a small, quiet smile, and they all seemed to like him.

It was a low-stress group, they didn’t argue much or antagonize each other for fun, and were fairly restful to be around, as long as they didn’t try to talk or interact with me in any way.

Mid expression of frustration, Ratthi said, “So we have no way to know if that creature was an aberration or if they live at the bottom of all those craters?”

Arada, who was one of the biology specialists, said, “You know, I bet they do. If those big avians we saw on the scans land on those barrier islands frequently, that creature might be preying on them.”

“It would explain what the craters are doing there,” Mensah said more thoughtfully. “That would be one anomaly out of the way, at least.”

“But who removed that subreport?” Pin-Lee said, which I agreed was the more important question here. She turned to me with one of those abrupt movements that I had taught myself not to react to. “Can the HubSystem be hacked?”

From the outside, I had no idea. It was as easy as breathing to do it from the inside, with the built-in interfaces in my own body. I had hacked it as soon as it had come online when we set up the habitat. I had to; if it monitored the governor module and my feed like it was supposed to, it could lead to a lot of awkward questions and me being stripped for parts. “As far as I know, it’s possible,” I said. “But it’s more likely the report was damaged before you received the survey package.”

Lowest bidder. Trust me on that one.

There were groans and general complaining about having to pay high prices for shitty equipment. (I don’t take it personally.) Mensah said, “Gurathin, maybe you and Pin-Lee can figure out what happened.” Most of my clients only know their specialties, and there’s no reason to send a system specialist along on a survey trip. The company supplies all the systems and attachments (the medical equipment, the drones, me, etc.) and will maintain it as part of the overall package the clients purchase. But Pin-Lee seemed to be a gifted amateur at system interpretation, and Gurathin had an advantage with his internal interface. Mensah added, “In the meantime, does the DeltFall Group have the same survey package as we do?”

I checked. HubSystem thought it was likely, but we knew what its opinion was worth now. “Probably,” I said. DeltFall was another survey group, like us, but they were on a continent on the opposite side of the planet. They were a bigger operation and had been dropped off by a different ship, so the humans hadn’t met in person, but they talked over the comm occasionally. They weren’t part of my contract and had their own SecUnits, the standard one per ten clients. We were supposed to be able to call on each other in emergencies, but being half a planet apart put a natural damper on that.

Mensah leaned back in her chair and steepled her fingers. “All right, this is what we’ll do. I want you each to check the individual sections of the survey package for your specialties. Try to pinpoint any more missing information. When we have a partial list, I’ll call DeltFall and see if they can send us the files.”

That sounded like a great plan, in that it didn’t involve me. I said, “Dr. Mensah, do you need me for anything else?”

She turned her chair to face me. “No, I’ll call if we have any questions.” I had worked for some contracts that would have kept me standing here the entire day and night cycle, just on the off chance they wanted me to do something and didn’t want to bother using the feed to call me. Then she added, “You know, you can stay here in the crew area if you want. Would you like that?”

They all looked at me, most of them smiling. One disadvantage in wearing the armor is that I get used to opaquing the faceplate. I’m out of practice at controlling my expression. Right now I’m pretty sure it was somewhere in the region of stunned horror, or maybe appalled horror.

Mensah sat up, startled. She said hurriedly, “Or not, you know, whatever you like.”

I said, “I need to check the perimeter,” and managed to turn and leave the crew area in a totally normal way and not like I was fleeing from a bunch of giant hostiles.

Back in the safety of the ready room, I leaned my head against the plastic-coated wall. Now they knew their murderbot didn’t want to be around them any more than they wanted to be around it. I’d given a tiny piece of myself away.

That can’t happen. I have too much to hide, and letting one piece go means the rest isn’t as protected.

I shoved away from the wall and decided to actually do some work. The missing subreport made me a little cautious. Not that there were any directives about it. My education modules were such cheap crap; most of the useful things I knew about security I learned from the edutainment programming on the entertainment feeds. (That’s another reason why they have to require these research groups and mining and biology and tech companies to rent one of us or they won’t guarantee the bond; we’re cheaply produced and we suck. Nobody would hire one of us for non-murdering purposes unless they had to.) 

Once I got my extra suit skin and spare set of armor on, I walked the perimeter and compared the current readings of the terrain and the seismic scans to the one we took when we first arrived. There were some notes in the feed from Ratthi and Arada, that fauna like the one we were now calling Hostile One might have made all the anomalous craters in the survey area. But nothing had changed around the habitat.

I also checked to make sure both the big hopper and the little hopper had their full complement of emergency supplies. I packed them in there myself days ago, but I was mainly checking to make sure the humans hadn’t done anything stupid with them since the last time I checked.

I did everything I could think of to do, then finally let myself go on standby while I caught up on my serials. I’d watched three episodes of Sanctuary Moon and was fast forwarding through a sex scene when Dr. Mensah sent me some images through the feed. (I don’t have any gender or sex-related parts (if a construct has those you’re a  in a brothel, not a murderbot) so maybe that’s why I find sex scenes boring. Though I think that even if I did have sex-related parts I would find them boring.) I took a look at the images in Mensah’s message, then saved my place in the serial.

Confession time: I don’t actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn’t looked at the maps yet and I’d barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we’d been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn’t had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn’t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don’t care.

So it was news to me that there were six missing sections from our map. Pin-Lee and Gurathin had found the discrepancies and Mensah wanted to know if I thought it was just the survey package being cheap and error-ridden or if I thought this was part of a hack. I appreciated the fact that we were communicating via the feed and that she wasn’t making me actually speak to her on the comm. I was so appreciative I gave her my real opinion, that it probably was the fact that our survey package was a cheap piece of crap but the only way to know for certain was to go out and look at one of the missing sections and see if there was anything there besides more boring planet. I didn’t phrase it exactly like that but that was what I meant.

She took her attention off the feed then, but I stayed alert, since I knew she tended to make her decisions fast and if I started a show again I’d just get interrupted. I did check the security-camera view of the hub so I could hear their conversation. They all wanted to check it out, and were just going back and forth on whether they should wait. They had just had a comm conversation with DeltFall on the other continent who had agreed to send copies of the missing survey package files. Some of the clients wanted to see if anything else was missing first, and others wanted to go now, and blah, blah, blah.

I knew how this was going to turn out.

It wasn’t a long trip, not far outside the range of the other assessments they had been doing, but not knowing what they were flying into was definitely a red flag for security. In a smart world, I should go alone, but with the governor module I had to be within a hundred meters of at least one of the clients at all times, or it would fry me. They knew that, so volunteering to take a solo cross-continental trip might set off a few alarms.

So when Mensah opened the feed again to tell me they were going, I told her security protocols suggested that I should go, too.

We got ready to leave at the beginning of the day cycle, in the morning light, and the satellite weather report said it would be a good day for flying and scanning. I checked MedSystem and saw Bharadwaj was awake and talking.

It wasn’t until I was helping to carry equipment to the little hopper that I realized they were going to make me ride in the crew cabin.

At least I was in the armor with my helmet opaqued. But when Mensah told me to get in the copilot’s seat, it didn’t turn out to be as bad as my first horrified realization. Arada and Pin-Lee didn’t try to talk to me, and Ratthi actually looked away when I eased past him to get to the cockpit.

They were all so careful not to look at me or talk to me directly that as soon as we were in the air I did a quick spot check through HubSystem’s records of their conversations. I had talked myself into believing that I hadn’t actually lost it as much as I thought I had when Mensah had offered to let me hang out in the hub with the humans like I was an actual person or something.

The conversation they had immediately after that gave me a sinking sensation as I reviewed it. No, it had been worse than I thought. They had talked it over and all agreed not to “push me any further than I wanted to go” and they were all so nice and it was just excruciating. I was never taking off the helmet again. I can’t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans.

They were the first clients I’d had who hadn’t had any previous experience with SecUnits, so maybe I could have expected this if I’d bothered to think about it. Letting them see me without the armor had been a huge mistake.

At least Mensah and Arada had overruled the ones who wanted to talk to me about it. Yes, talk to Murderbot about its feelings. The idea was so painful I dropped to 97 percent efficiency. I’d rather climb back into Hostile One’s mouth.

I worried about it while they looked out the windows at the ring or watched their feeds of the hopper’s scans of the new scenery, chatting on the comm with the others who were following our progress back in the habitat. I was distracted, but still caught the moment when the autopilot cut out.

It could have been a problem, except I was in the copilot’s seat and I could have taken over in time. But even if I hadn’t been there, it would have turned out okay, because Mensah was flying and she never took her hands off the controls.

Even though the planetary craft autopilots aren’t as sophisticated as a full bot-pilot system, some clients will still engage it and then walk into the back, or sleep. Mensah didn’t and she made sure when the others flew they followed her rules. She just made some thoughtful grumpy noises and adjusted our course away from the mountain the failing autopilot would have slammed us into.

I had cycled out of horrified that they wanted to talk to me about my feelings into grateful that she had ordered them not to. As she restarted the autopilot, I pulled the log and sent it into the feed to show her it had cut out due to a HubSystem glitch. She swore under her breath and shook her head.

The missing map section wasn’t that far outside our assessment range so we were there before I made a dent in the backlog of serials I’d saved to my internal storage. Mensah told the others, “We’re coming up on it.”

We had been traveling over heavy tropical forest, where it flowed over deep valleys. Suddenly it dropped away into a plain, spotted with lakes and smaller copses of trees. There was a lot of bare rock, in low ridges and tumbled boulders. It was dark and glassy, like volcanic glass.

The cabin was quiet as everybody studied the scans. Arada was looking at the seismic data, bouncing it to the others back in the habitat through her feed.

“I don’t see anything that would prevent the satellite from mapping this region,” Pin-Lee said, her voice distant as she sorted through the data the hopper was pulling in. “No strange readings. It’s weird.”

“Unless this rock has some sort of stealth property that prevented the satellites from imaging it,” Arada said. “The scanners are acting a little funny.”

“Because the scanners suck corporation balls,” Pin-Lee muttered.

“Should we land?” Mensah said. I realized she was asking me for a security assessment.

The scans were sort of working and marking some hazards, but they weren’t any different hazards from what we’d run into before. I said, “We could. But we know there’s at least one lifeform here that tunnels through rock.”

Arada bounced a little in her seat, like she was impatient to get going. “I know we have to be cautious, but I think we’d be safer if we knew whether these blank patches on the satellite scan were accidental or deliberate.”

That was when I realized they weren’t ignoring the possibility of sabotage. I should have realized it earlier, when Pin-Lee asked if HubSystem could be hacked. But humans had been looking at me and I had just wanted to get out of there.

Ratthi and Pin-Lee seconded her, and Mensah made her decision. “We’ll land and take samples.”

Over the comm from the habitat, Bharadwaj’s voice said, “Please be careful.” She still sounded shaky.

Mensah took us down gently, the hopper’s pads touching the ground with hardly a thump. I was already up and at the hatch.

The humans had their suit helmets on so I opened the hatch and let the ramp drop. Close up the rocky patches still looked like glass, mostly black, but with different colors running into each other. This near to the ground the hopper’s scan was able to confirm that seismic activity was null, but I walked out a little bit, as if giving anything out there a chance to attack me. If the humans see me actually doing my job, it helps keep suspicions from forming about faulty governor modules.

Mensah climbed down with Arada behind her. They moved around, taking more readings with their portable scanners. Then the others got the sample kit outs and started chipping off pieces of the rock glass, or glass rock, scooping up dirt and bits of plant matter. They were murmuring to each other a lot, and to the others back at the habitat. They were sending the data to the feed, but I wasn’t paying attention.

It was an odd spot. Quiet compared to the other places we’d surveyed, with not much bird-thing noise and no sign of animal movement. Maybe the rocky patches kept them away. I walked out a little way, past a couple of the lakes, almost expecting to see something under the surface. Dead bodies, maybe. I’d seen plenty of those (and caused plenty of those) on past contracts, but this one had been dead-body-lacking, so far. It made for a nice change.

Mensah had set a survey perimeter, marking all the areas the aerial scan had flagged as hazardous or potentially hazardous. I checked on everybody again and saw Arada and Ratthi heading directly for one of the hazard markers. I expected them to stop at the perimeter, since they’d been pretty consistently cautious on the other assessments. I started moving in that direction anyway. Then they passed the perimeter. I started to run. I sent Mensah my field camera feed and used the voice comm to say, “Dr. Arada, Dr. Ratthi, please stop. You’re past the perimeter and nearing a hazard marker.”

“We are?” Ratthi sounded completely baffled.

Fortunately, they both stopped. By the time I got there they both had their maps up in my feed. “I don’t understand what’s wrong,” Arada said, confused. “I don’t see the hazard marker.” She had tagged both their positions and on their maps they were well within the perimeter, heading toward a wetland area.

It took me a second to see what the problem was. Then I superimposed my map, the actual map, over theirs and sent that to Mensah. “Shit,” she said over the comm. “Ratthi, Arada, your map’s wrong. How did that happen?”

“It’s a glitch,” Ratthi said. He grimaced, studying the displays in his feed. “It’s wiped out all the markers on this side.”

So that was how I spent the rest of the morning, shooing humans away from hazard markers they couldn’t see, while Pin-Lee cursed a lot and tried to get the mapping scanner to work. “I’m beginning to think these missing sections are just a mapping error,” Ratthi said at one point, panting. He had walked into what they called a hot mud pit and I’d had to pull him out. We were both covered with acidic mud to the waist.

“You think?” Pin-Lee answered tiredly.

When Mensah told us to head back to the hopper, it was a relief all around.

We got back to the habitat with no problems, which felt like it was starting to become an unusual occurrence. The humans went to analyze their data, and I went to hide in the ready room, check the security feeds, and then lie in my cubicle and watch media for a while.

I’d just done another perimeter walk and checked the drones, when the feed informed me that HubSystem had updates from the satellite and there was a package for me. I have a trick where I make HubSystem think I received it and then just put it in external storage. I don’t do automated package updates anymore, now that I don’t have to. When I felt like it, presumably sometime before it was time to leave the planet, I’d go through the update and apply the parts I wanted and delete the rest.

It was a typical, boring day, in other words. If Bharadwaj wasn’t still recuperating in Medical, you could almost forget what had happened. But at the end of the day cycle, Dr. Mensah called me again and said, “I think we have a problem. We can’t contact DeltFall Group.”

I went to the crew hub where Mensah and all the others were. They had pulled up the maps and scans of where we were versus where DeltFall was, and the curve of the planet hung glittering in the air in the big display. When I got there, Mensah was saying, “I’ve checked the big hopper’s specs and we can make it there and back without a recharge.”

I had my helmet plate opaqued, so I could wince a lot without any of them knowing.

“You don’t think they’ll let us recharge at their habitat?” Arada asked, then looked around when the others stared at her. “What?” she demanded.

Overse put an arm around her and squeezed her shoulder. “If they aren’t answering our calls, they might be hurt, or their habitat is damaged,” she said. As a couple, they were always so nice to each other. The whole group had been remarkably drama-free so far, which I appreciated. The last few contracts had been like being an involuntary bystander in one of the entertainment feed’s multi-partner relationship serials except I’d hated the whole cast.

Mensah nodded. “That’s my concern, especially if their survey package was missing potential hazard information the way ours is.”

Arada looked like it was just occurring to her that everybody over at DeltFall might be dead.

Ratthi said, “The thing that worries me is that their emergency beacon didn’t launch. If the habitat was breached, or if there was a medical emergency they couldn’t handle, their HubSystem should have triggered the beacon automatically.”

Each survey team has its own beacon, set up a safe distance from the habitat. It would launch into a low orbit and send a pulse toward the wormhole, which would get zapped or whatever happened in the wormhole and the company network would get it, and the pickup transport would be sent now instead of waiting until the end of project date. That was how it was supposed to work, anyway. Usually. 

Mensah’s expression said she was worried. She looked at me. “What do you think?”

It took me two seconds to realize she was talking to me. Fortunately, since it seemed like we were really doing this, I had actually been paying attention and didn’t need to play the conversation back. I said, “They have three contracted SecUnits but if their habitat was hit by a hostile as big or bigger than Hostile One, their comm equipment could have been damaged.”

Pin-Lee was calling up specs for the beacons. “Aren’t the emergency beacons designed to trigger even if the rest of the comm equipment is destroyed?”

The other good thing about my hacked governor module is that I could ignore the governor’s instructions to defend the stupid company. “They’re supposed to be able to, but equipment failures aren’t unknown.”

There was a moment where they all thought about potential equipment failures in their habitat, maybe including the big hopper which they were about to fly out of range of the little hopper, so if something happened to it they were walking back. And swimming back, since that was an ocean-sized body of water between the two points on the map. Or drown; I guess they could just drown. If you were wondering why I was wincing earlier, this would be the reason.

The trip to the map’s black-out region had been a little out of our assessment parameters, but this was going to be an overnight trip, even if all they did was get there, see a bunch of dead people, turn around and go back.

Then Gurathin said, “What about your systems?”

I didn’t turn my helmet toward him because that can be intimidating and it’s especially important for me to resist that urge. “I carefully monitor my own systems.” What else did he think I was going to say? It didn’t matter; I’m not refundable.

Volescu cleared his throat. “So we should prepare for a rescue mission.” He looked okay, but MedSystem’s feed was still reporting some indicators of distress. Bharadwaj was stable but not allowed to get out of Medical yet. He continued, “I’ve pulled some instructions from the hopper’s info package.”

Yes, instructions. They’re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality. I said, “Dr. Mensah, I think I should go along.”

I could see her notes in the feed so I knew she meant for me to stay here and watch the habitat and guard everybody who wasn’t going. She was taking Pin-Lee, because she had past experience in habitat and shelter construction; Ratthi, who was a biologist; and Overse, who was certified as a field medic.

Mensah hesitated, thinking about it, and I could tell she was debating protecting the habitat and the group staying behind with the possibility of whatever had hit DeltFall still being there. She took a breath and I knew she was going to tell me to stay here. And I just thought, That’s a bad idea. I couldn’t explain to myself why. It was one of those impulses that comes from my organic parts that the governor is supposed to squash. I said, “As the only one here with experience in these situations, I’m your best resource.”

Gurathin said, “What situations?”

Ratthi gave him a bemused look. “This situation. The unknown. Strange threats. Monsters exploding out of the ground.”

I was glad I wasn’t the only one who thought it was a dumb question. Gurathin wasn’t as talkative as the others, so I didn’t have much of a sense of his personality. He was the only augmented human in the group, so maybe he felt like an outsider, or something, even though the others clearly liked him. I clarified, “Situations where personnel might be injured due to attack by planetary hazards.”

Arada came in on my side. “I agree. I think you should take SecUnit. You don’t know what’s out there.”

Mensah was still undecided. “Depending on what we find, we may be gone as long as two or three days.”

Arada waved a hand, indicating the habitat. “Nothing’s bothered us here so far.”

That was probably what DeltFall had thought, right before they got eaten or torn to pieces or whatever. But Volescu said, “I admit it would make me feel better about it.” From Medical, Bharadwaj tapped into the feed to add her vote for me. Gurathin was the only one staying behind who didn’t say anything.

Mensah nodded firmly. “All right then, it’s decided. Now let’s get moving.”

So I prepped the big hopper to go to the other side of the planet. (And yes, I had to pull up the instructions.) I checked it over as much as I could, remembering how the autopilot had cut out suddenly in the little hopper. But we hadn’t used the big hopper since Mensah had taken it up to check it out when we arrived. (You had to check everything out and log any problems immediately when you took delivery or the company wasn’t liable.) But everything looked okay, or at least matched what the specs said it was supposed to match. It was only there for emergencies and if this thing with DeltFall hadn’t happened, we would probably never have touched it until it was time to lift it onto our pickup transport.

Mensah came to do her own check of the hopper, and told me to pack some extra emergency supplies for the DeltFall staff. I did it, and I hoped for the humans’ sake we would need them. I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need for DeltFall was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.

When everything was ready, Overse, Ratthi, and Pin-Lee climbed in, and I stood hopefully by the cargo pod. Mensah pointed at the cabin. I winced behind my opaque faceplate and climbed in.

We flew through the night, the humans taking scans and discussing the new terrain past our assessment range. It was especially interesting for them to see what was there, now that we knew our map wasn’t exactly reliable.

Mensah gave everybody watch shifts, including me. This was new, but not unwelcome, as it meant I had blocks of time where I wasn’t supposed to be paying attention and didn’t have to fake it. Mensah, Pin-Lee, and Overse were all taking turns as pilot and copilot, so I didn’t have to worry so much about the autopilot trying to kill us, and I could go on standby and watch my stored supply of serials.

We’d been in the air awhile, and Mensah was piloting with Pin-Lee in the copilot’s seat, when Ratthi turned in his seat to face me and said, “We heard—we were given to understand, that Imitative Human Bot Units are . . . partially constructed from cloned material.”

Warily, I stopped the show I was watching. I didn’t like where this might go. All of that information is in the common knowledge database, plus in the brochure the company provides with the specifics of the types of units they use. Which he knew, being a scientist and whatever. And he wasn’t the kind of human who asked about things when he could look them up himself through a feed. “That’s true,” I said, very careful to make my voice sound just as neutral as always.

Ratthi’s expression was troubled. “But surely . . . It’s clear you have feelings—”

I flinched. I couldn’t help it.

Overse had been working in the feed, analyzing data from the assessments. She looked up, frowning. “Ratthi, what are you doing?” 

Ratthi shifted guiltily. “I know Mensah asked us not to, but—” He waved a hand. “You saw it.”

Overse pulled her interface off. “You’re upsetting it,” she said, teeth gritted.

“That’s my point!” He gestured in frustration. “The practice is disgusting, it’s horrible, it’s slavery. This is no more a machine than Gurathin is—”

Exasperated, Overse said, “And you don’t think it knows that?”

I’m supposed to let the clients do and say whatever they want to me and with an intact governor module I wouldn’t have a choice. I’m also not supposed to snitch on clients to anybody except the company, but it was either that or jump out the hatch. I sent the conversation into the feed tagged for Mensah.

From the cockpit, she shouted, “Ratthi! We talked about this!”

I slid out of the seat and went to the back of the hopper, as far away as I could get, facing the supply lockers and the head. It was a mistake; it wasn’t a normal thing for a SecUnit with an intact governor module to do, but they didn’t notice.

“I’ll apologize,” Ratthi was saying.

“No, just leave it alone,” Mensah told him.

“That would just make it worse,” Overse added.

I stood there until they all calmed down and got quiet again, then slid into a seat in the back, and resumed the serial I’d been watching.

It was the middle of the night when I felt the feed drop out.

I hadn’t been using it, but I had the SecSystem feeds from the drones and the interior cameras backburnered and was accessing them occasionally to make sure everything was okay. The humans left behind in the habitat were more active than they usually were at this time, probably anxious about what we were going to find at DeltFall. I was hearing Arada walk around occasionally, though Volescu was snoring off and on in his bunk. Bharadwaj had been able to move back to her own quarters, but was restless and going over her field notes through the feed. Gurathin was in the hub doing something on his personal system. I wondered what he was doing and had just started to carefully poke around through HubSystem to find out. When the feed dropped it was like someone slapped the organic part of my brain.

I sat up and said, “The satellite went down.”

The others, except for Pin-Lee who was piloting, all grabbed for their interfaces. I saw their expressions when they felt the silence. Mensah pushed out of her seat and came to the back. “Are you sure it was the satellite?”

“I’m sure,” I told her. “I’m pinging it and there’s no response.”

We still had our local feed, running on the hopper’s system, so we could communicate through it as well as the comm and share data with each other. We just didn’t have nearly as much data as we’d have had if we were still attached to HubSystem. We were far enough away that we needed the comm satellite as a relay. Ratthi switched his interface to the hopper’s feed and started checking the scans. There was nothing on them except empty sky; I had them backburnered but I’d set them to notify me if they encountered anything like an energy reading or a large life sign. He said, “I just felt a chill. Did anyone else feel a chill?”

“A little,” Overse admitted. “It’s a weird coincidence, isn’t it?”

“The damn satellite’s had periodic outages since we got here,” Pin-Lee pointed out from the cockpit. “We just don’t normally need it for comms.” She was right. I was supposed to check their personal logs periodically in case they were plotting to defraud the company or murder each other or something, and the last time I’d looked at Pin-Lee’s she had been tracking the satellite problems, trying to figure out if there was a pattern. It was one of the many things I didn’t care about because the entertainment feed was only updated occasionally, and I downloaded it for local storage.

Ratthi shook his head. “But this is the first time we’ve been far enough from the habitat to need it for comm contact. It just seems odd, and not in a good way.”

Mensah looked around at them. “Does anyone want to turn back?”

I did, but I didn’t get a vote. The others sat there for a quiet moment, then Overse said, “If it turns out the DeltFall group did need help, and we didn’t go, how would we feel?”

“If there’s a chance we can save lives, we have to take it,” Pin-Lee agreed.

Ratthi sighed. “No, you’re right. I’d feel terrible if anyone died because we were overcautious.”

“We’re agreed, then,” Mensah said. “We’ll keep going.”

I would have preferred they be overcautious. I had had contracts before where the company’s equipment glitched this badly, but there was just something about this that made me think it was more. But all I had was the feeling.

I had four hours to my next scheduled watch so I went into standby, and buried myself in the downloads I’d stored away.

It was dawn when we got there. DeltFall had established their camp in a wide valley surrounded by high mountains. A spiderweb of creek beds cut through the grass and stubby trees. They were a bigger operation than ours, with three linked habitats, and a shelter for surface vehicles, plus a landing area for two large hoppers, a cargo hauler, and three small hoppers. It was all company equipment though, per contract, and all subject to the same malfunctions as the crap they’d dumped on us.

There was no one outside, no movement. No sign of damage, no sign any hostile fauna had approached. The satellite was still dead, but Mensah had been trying to get the DeltFall habitat on the comm since we had come within range.

“Are they missing any transports?” Mensah asked.

Ratthi checked the record of what they were supposed to have which I’d copied from HubSystem before we left. “No, the hoppers are all there. Their ground vehicles are in that shelter, I think.”

I had moved up to the front as we got closer. Standing behind the pilot’s seat, I said, “Dr. Mensah, I recommend you land outside their perimeter.” Through the local feed I sent her all the info I had, which was that their automated systems were responding to the pings the hopper was sending, but that was it. We weren’t picking up their feed, which meant their HubSystem was in standby. There was nothing from their three SecUnits, not even pings.

Overse, in the copilot’s seat, glanced up at me. “Why?”

I had to answer the question so I said, “Security protocol,” which sounded good and didn’t commit me to anything. No one outside, no one answering the comm. Unless they had all jumped in their surface vehicles and gone off on vacation, leaving their Hub and SecUnits shut down, they were dead. Pessimism confirmed.

But we couldn’t be sure without looking. The hopper’s scanners can’t see inside the habitats because of the shielding that’s really only there to protect proprietary data, so we couldn’t get any life signs or energy readings.

This is why I didn’t want to come. I’ve got four perfectly good humans here and I didn’t want them to get killed by whatever took out DeltFall. It’s not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.

“We’re just being cautious,” Mensah said, answering Overse. She took the hopper down at the edge of the valley, on the far side of the streams. 

I gave Mensah a few hints through the feed, that they should break out the handweapons in the survival gear, that Ratthi should stay behind inside the hopper with the hatch sealed and locked since he’d never done the weapon-training course, and that, most important, I should go first. They were quiet, subdued. Up until now, I think they had all been looking at this as probably a natural disaster, that they were going to be digging survivors out of a collapsed habitat, or helping fight off a herd of Hostile Ones.

This was something else.

Mensah gave the orders and we started forward, me in front, the humans a few steps behind. They were in their full suits with helmets, which gave some protection but had been meant for environmental hazards, not some other heavily armed human (or angry malfunctioning rogue SecUnit) deliberately trying to kill them. I was more nervous than Ratthi, who was jittery on our comms, monitoring the scans, and basically telling us to be careful every other step.

I had my built-in energy weapons and the big projectile weapon I was cradling. I also had six drones, pulled from the hopper’s supply and under my control through its feed. They were the small kind, barely a centimeter across; no weapons, just cameras. (They make some which aren’t much bigger and have a small pulse weapon, but you have to get one of the upper-tier company packages mostly designed for much larger contracts.) I told the drones to get in the air and gave them a scouting pattern.

I did that because it seemed sensible, not because I knew what I was doing. I am not a combat murderbot, I’m Security. I keep things from attacking the clients and try to gently discourage the clients from attacking each other. I was way out of my depth here, which was another reason I hadn’t wanted the humans to come here.

We crossed the shallow streams, sending a group of water invertebrates scattering away from our boots. The trees were short and sparse enough that I had a good view of the camp from this angle. I couldn’t detect any DeltFall security drones, by eye or with the scanners on my drones. Ratthi in the hopper wasn’t picking up anything either. I really, really wished I could pinpoint the location of those three SecUnits, but I wasn’t getting anything from them.

SecUnits aren’t sentimental about each other. We aren’t friends, the way the characters on the serials are, or the way my humans were. We can’t trust each other, even if we work together. Even if you don’t have clients who decide to entertain themselves by ordering their SecUnits to fight each other.

The scans read the perimeter sensors as dead and the drones weren’t picking up any warning indicators. The DeltFall HubSystem was down, and without it, no one inside could access our feed or comms, theoretically. We crossed over and into the landing area for their hoppers. They were between us and the first habitat, the vehicle storage to one side. I was leading us in at an angle, trying to get a visual on the main habitat door, but I was also checking the ground. It was mostly bare of grass from all the foot traffic and hopper landings. From the weather report we’d gotten before the satellite quit, it had rained here last night, and the mud had hardened. No activity since then.

I passed that info to Mensah through the feed and she told the others. Keeping her voice low, Pin-Lee said, “So whatever happened, it wasn’t long after we spoke to them on the comm.”

“They couldn’t have been attacked by someone,” Overse whispered. There was no reason to whisper, but I understood the impulse. “There’s no one else on this planet.”

“There’s not supposed to be anyone else on this planet,” Ratthi said, darkly, over the comm from our hopper.

There were three SecUnits who were not me on this planet, and that was dangerous enough. I got my visual on the main habitat hatch and saw it was shut, no sign of anything forcing its way inside. The drones had circled the whole structure by now, and showed me the other entrances were the same. That was that. Hostile Fauna don’t come to the door and ask to be let inside. I sent the images to Mensah’s feed and said aloud, “Dr. Mensah, it would be better if I went ahead.”

She hesitated, reviewing what I’d just sent her. I saw her shoulders tense. I think she had just come to the same conclusion I had. Or at least admitted to herself that it was the strongest possibility. She said, “All right. We’ll wait here. Make sure we can monitor.”

She’d said “we” and she wouldn’t have said that if she didn’t mean it, unlike some clients I’d had. I sent my field camera’s feed to all four of them and started forward.

I called four of the drones back, leaving two to keep circling the perimeter. I checked the vehicle shed as I moved past it. It was open on one side, with some sealed lockers in the back for storage. All four of their surface vehicles were there, powered down, no sign of recent tracks, so I didn’t go in. I wouldn’t bother searching the small storage spaces until we got down to the looking-for-all-the-body-parts phase.

I walked up to the hatch of the first habitat. We didn’t have an entry code, so I was expecting to have to blow the door, but when I tapped the button it slid open for me. I told Mensah through the feed that I wouldn’t speak aloud on the comm anymore.

She tapped back an acknowledgment on the feed, and I heard her telling the others to get off my feed and my comm, that she was going to be the only one speaking to me so I wasn’t distracted. Mensah underestimated my ability to ignore humans but I appreciated the thought. Ratthi whispered, “Be careful,” and signed off.

I had the weapon up going in, through the suit locker area and into the first corridor. “No suits missing,” Mensah said in my ear, watching the field camera. I sent my four drones ahead, maintaining an interior scouting pattern. This was a nicer habitat than ours, wider halls, newer. Also empty, silent, the smell of decaying flesh drifting through my helmet filters. I headed toward the hub, where their main crew area should be.

The lights were still on and air whispered through the vents, but I couldn’t get into their SecSystem with their feed down. I missed my cameras.

At the door to the hub, I found their first SecUnit. It was sprawled on its back on the floor, the armor over its chest pierced by something that made a hole approximately ten centimeters wide and a little deeper. We’re hard to kill, but that’ll do it. I did a brief scan to make sure it was inert, then stepped over it and went through into the crew area.

There were eleven messily dead humans in the hub, sprawled on the floor, in chairs, the monitoring stations and projection surfaces behind them showing impact damage from projectile and energy weapon fire. I tapped the feed and asked Mensah to fall back to the hopper. She acknowledged me and I got confirmation from my outside drones that the humans were retreating.

I went out the opposite door to a corridor that led toward the mess hall, Medical, and cabins. The drones were telling me the layout was very similar to our habitat, except for the occasional dead person sprawled in the corridors. The weapon that had taken out the dead SecUnit wasn’t in the hub, and it had died with its back to the door. The DeltFall humans had had some warning, enough to start getting up and heading for the other exits, but something else had come in from this direction and trapped them. I thought that SecUnit had been killed trying to protect the hub.

Which meant I was looking for the other two SecUnits.

Maybe these clients had been terrible and abusive, maybe they had deserved it. I didn’t care. Nobody was touching my humans. To make sure of that I had to kill these two rogue Units. I could have pulled out at this point, sabotaged the hoppers, and got my humans out of there, leaving the rogue Units stuck on the other side of an ocean; that would have been the smart thing to do. 

But I wanted to kill them.

One of my drones found two humans dead in the mess, no warning. They had been taking food pacs out of the heating cubby, getting the tables ready for a meal.

While I moved through the corridors and rooms, I was doing an image search against the hopper’s equipment database. The dead unit had probably been killed by a mineral survey tool, like a pressure or sonic drill. We had one on the hopper, part of the standard equipment. You would have to get close to use it with enough force to pierce armor, maybe a little more than a meter.

Because you can’t walk up to another murderbot with an armor-piercing projectile or energy weapon inside the habitat and not be looked at with suspicion. You can walk up to a fellow murderbot with a tool that a human might have asked you to get.

By the time I reached the other side of the structure, the drones had cleared the first habitat. I stood in the hatchway at the top of the narrow corridor that led into the second. A human lay at the opposite end, half in and half out of the open hatch. To get into the next habitat, I’d have to step over her to push the door all the way open. I could tell already that something was wrong about the body position. I used the magnification on the field camera to get a closer view of the skin on the outstretched arm. The lividity was wrong; she had been shot in the chest or face and lay on her back for some time, then had been moved here recently. Probably as soon as they picked up our hopper on the way here.

On the feed I told Mensah what I needed her to do. She didn’t ask questions. She’d been watching my field camera, and she knew by now what we were dealing with. She tapped back to acknowledge me, then said aloud on the comm, “SecUnit, I want you to hold your position until I get there.”

I said, “Yes, Dr. Mensah,” and eased back out of the hatch. I moved fast, back to the security ready room.

It was nice having a human smart enough to work with like this.

Our model of habitat didn’t have it but on these bigger ones there’s a roof access and my outside drones had a good view of it.

I climbed the ladder up to the roof hatch and popped it. The armor’s boots have magnetized climbing clamps, and I used them to cross over the curving roofs to the third habitat and then around to the second, coming up on them from behind. Even these two rogues wouldn’t be dumb enough to ignore the creaks if I took the quick route and walked over to their position.

(They were not the sharpest murderbots, having cleaned the floor of the between-habitat corridor to cover the prints they had left when staging that body. It would have fooled somebody who hadn’t noticed all the other floors were covered with tracked-in dust.)

I opened the roof access for the second habitat and sent my drones ahead down into the Security ready room. Once they checked the unit cubicles and made sure nobody was home, I dropped down the ladder. A lot of their equipment was still there, including their drones. There was a nice box of new ones, but they were useless without the DeltFall HubSystem. Either it was really dead or doing a good imitation of it. I still kept part of my attention on it; if it came up suddenly and reactivated the security cameras, the rules of the game would change abruptly.

Keeping my drones with me, I took the inner corridor and moved silently past Medical’s blasted hatch. Three bodies were piled inside where the humans had tried to secure it and been trapped when their own SecUnits blew it open to slaughter them.

When I was close to the corridor with the hatch where both units were waiting for me and Dr. Mensah to come wandering in, I sent the drones around for a careful look. Oh yeah, there they were.

With no weapons on my drones, the only way to do this was to move fast. So I threw myself around the last corner, hit the opposite wall, crossed back and kept going, firing at their positions.

I hit the first one with three explosive bolts in the back and one in the faceplate as it turned toward me. It dropped. The other one I nicked in the arm, taking out the joint, and it made the mistake of switching its main weapon to its other hand, which gave me a couple of seconds. I switched to rapid fire to keep it off balance, then back to the explosive bolt. That dropped it.

I hit the floor, needing a minute to recover.

I had taken at least a dozen hits from both of their energy weapons while I was taking out the first one, but the explosive bolts had missed me, going past to tear up the corridor. Even with the armor, bits of me were going numb, but I had only taken three projectiles to the right shoulder, four to the left hip. This is how we fight: throw ourselves at each other and see whose parts give out first.

Neither unit was dead. But they were incapable of reaching their cubicles in the ready room, and I sure as hell wasn’t going to give them a hand.

Three of my drones were down, too; they had gone into combat mode and slammed in ahead of me to draw fire. One had gotten hit by a stray energy burst and was wandering around in the corridor behind me. I checked my two perimeter drones by habit, and opened my comm to Dr. Mensah to tell her I still needed to clear the rest of the habitat and do the formal check for survivors.

The drone behind me went out with a fizzle that I heard and saw on the feed. I think I realized immediately what that meant but there may have been a half second or so of delay. But I was on my feet when something hit me so hard I was suddenly on my back on the floor, systems failing.

I came back online to no vision, no hearing, no ability to move. I couldn’t reach the feed or the comm. Not good, Murderbot, not good.

I suddenly got some weird flashes of sensation, all from my organic parts. Air on my face, my arms, through rips in my suit. On the burning wound in my shoulder. Someone had taken off my helmet and the upper part of my armor. The sensations were only for seconds at a time. It was confusing and I wanted to scream. Maybe this was how murderbots died. You lose function, go offline, but parts of you keep working, organic pieces kept alive by the fading energy in your power cells.

Then I knew someone was moving me, and I really wanted to scream.

I fought back panic, and got a few more flashes of sensation. I wasn’t dead. I was in a lot of trouble.

I waited to get some kind of function back, frantic, disoriented, terrified, wondering why they hadn’t blown a hole in my chest. Sound came first, and I knew something leaned over me. Faint noises from the joints told me it was a SecUnit. But there’d only been three. I’d checked the DeltFall specs before we left. I do a half-assed job sometimes, okay, most of the time, but Pin-Lee had checked, too, and she was thorough.

Then my organic parts started to sting, the numbness wearing off. I was designed to work with both organic and machine parts, to balance that sensory input. Without the balance, I felt like a balloon floating in mid-air. But the organic part of my chest was in contact with a hard surface, and that abruptly brought my position into focus. I was lying face down, one arm dangling. They’d put me on a table?

This was definitely not good.

Pressure on my back, then on my head. The rest of me was coming back but slowly, slowly. I felt for the feed but couldn’t reach it. Then something stabbed me in the back of the neck.

That’s organic material and with the rest of me down there was nothing to control input from my nervous system. It felt like they were sawing my head off.

A shock went through me and suddenly the rest of me was back online. I popped the joint on my left arm so I could move it in a way not usually compatible with a human, augmented human, or murderbot body. I reached up to the pressure and pain on my neck, and grabbed an armored wrist. I twisted my whole body and took us both off the table. 

We hit the floor and I clamped my legs around the other SecUnit as we rolled. It tried to trigger the weapons built into its forearm but my reaction speed was off the chart and I clamped a hand over the port so it couldn’t open fully. My vision was back and I could see its opaqued helmet inches away. My armor had been removed down to my waist, and that just made me more angry.

I shoved its hand up under its chin and took the pressure off its weapon. It had a split second to try to abort that fire command and it failed. The energy burst went through my hand and the join between its helmet and neck piece. Its head jerked and its body started to spasm. I let go of it long enough to kneel up, get my intact arm around its neck, and twist.

I let go as I felt the connections, mechanical and organic, snap.

I looked up and another SecUnit was in the doorway, lifting a large projectile weapon.

How many of these damn things were here? It didn’t matter, because I tried to shove myself upright but I couldn’t react fast enough. Then it jerked, dropped the weapon, and fell forward. I saw two things: the ten-centimeter hole in its back and Mensah standing behind it, holding something that looked a lot like the sonic mining drill from our hopper.

“Dr. Mensah,” I said, “this is a violation of security priority and I am contractually obligated to record this for report to the company—” It was in the buffer and the rest of my brain was empty.

She ignored me, talking to Pin-Lee on the comm, and strode forward to grab my arm and pull. I was too heavy for her so I shoved upright so she wouldn’t hurt herself. It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn’t look like the ones on the entertainment feed.

She kept pulling on me so I kept moving. Something was wrong with one of my hip joints. Oh, right, I got shot there. Blood ran down my torn suit skin and I reached up to my neck. I expected to feel a gaping hole, but there was something stuck there. “Dr. Mensah, there might be more rogue units, we don’t know—”

“That’s why we need to hurry,” she said, dragging me along. She had brought the last two drones with her from outside, but they were uselessly circling her head. Humans don’t have enough access to the feed to control them and do other things, like walk and talk. I tried to reach them but I still couldn’t get a clear link to the hopper’s feed.

We turned into another corridor and Overse waited in the outer hatch. She hit the open panel as soon as she saw us. She had her handweapon out and I had time to notice that Mensah had my weapon under her other arm. “Dr. Mensah, I need my weapon.”

“You’re missing a hand and part of your shoulder,” she snapped. Overse grabbed a handful of my suit skin and helped pull me out of the hatch. Dust swirled in the air as the hopper set down two meters away, barely clearing the habitat’s extendable roof.

“Yeah, I know, but—” The hatch opened and Ratthi ducked out, grabbed the collar of my suit skin, and pulled all three of us up into the cabin.

I collapsed on the deck as we lifted off. I needed to do something about the hip joint. I tried to check the scan to make sure nobody was on the ground shooting at us but even here my connection to the hopper’s system was twitchy, glitching so much I couldn’t see any reports from the instrumentation, like something was blocking the . . .

Uh-oh.

I felt the back of my neck again. The larger part of the obstruction was gone, but I could feel something in the port now. My data port.

The DeltFall SecUnits hadn’t been rogues, they had been inserted with combat override modules. The modules allow personal control over a SecUnit, turn it from a mostly autonomous construct into a gun puppet. The feed would be cut off, control would be over the comm, but functionality would depend on how complex the orders were. “Kill the humans” isn’t a complex order.

Mensah stood over me, Ratthi leaned across a seat to look out toward the DeltFall camp, Overse popped open one of the storage lockers. They were talking, but I couldn’t catch it. I sat up and said, “Mensah, you need to shut me down now.”

“What?” She looked down at me. “We’re getting—emergency repair—”

Sound was breaking up. It was the download flooding my system, and my organic parts weren’t used to processing that much information. “The unknown SecUnit inserted a data carrier, a combat-override module. It’s downloading instructions into me and will override my system. This is why the two DeltFall units turned rogue. You have to stop me.” I don’t know why I was dancing around the word. Maybe because I thought she didn’t want to hear it. She’d just shot a heavily armed SecUnit with a mining drill to get me back; presumably she wanted to keep me. “You have to kill me.”

It took forever for them to realize what I’d said, put it together with what they must have seen on my field camera feed, but my ability to measure time was glitching, too.

“No,” Ratthi said, looking down at me, horrified. “No, we can’t—”

Mensah said, “We won’t. Pin-Lee—”

Overse dropped the repair kit and climbed over two rows of seats, yelling for Pin-Lee. I knew she was going to the cockpit to take the controls so Pin-Lee could work on me. I knew she wouldn’t have time to fix me. I knew I could kill everyone on the hopper, even with a blown hip joint and one working arm.

So I grabbed the handweapon lying on the seat, turned it toward my chest, and pulled the trigger.

PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY AT 10% AND DROPPING
SHUTDOWN INITIATED

I came back online to find I was inert, but slowly cycling into a wake-up phase. I was agitated, my levels were all off, and I had no idea why. I played back my personal log. Oh, right.

I shouldn’t be waking up. I hoped they hadn’t been stupid about it, too soft-hearted to kill me.

You notice I didn’t point the weapon at my head. I didn’t want to kill myself, but it was going to have to be done. I could have incapacitated myself some other way, but let’s face it, I didn’t want to sit around and listen to the part where they convinced each other that there was no other choice.

A diagnostic initiated and informed me the combat override module had been removed. For a second I didn’t believe it. I opened my security feed and found a camera for Medical. I was lying on the procedure table, my armor gone, just wearing what was left of my suit skin, the humans gathered around. That was a bit of a nightmare image. But my shoulder, hand, and hip had been repaired, so I’d been in my cubicle at some point. I ran the recording back a little and watched Pin-Lee and Overse use the surgical suite to deftly remove the combat module from the back of my head. It was such a relief, I played the recording twice, then ran a diagnostic. My logs were clear; nothing there except what I’d had before entering the DeltFall habitat.

My clients are the best clients.

Then hearing came online.

“I’ve had HubSystem immobilize it,” Gurathin said.

Huh. Well, that explained a lot. I still had control of SecSystem and I told it to freeze HubSystem’s access to its feed and implement my emergency routine. This was a function I’d built in that would substitute an hour or so of ambient habitat noise in place of the visual and audio recordings HubSystem made. To anyone listening to us through HubSystem, or trying to play back the recording, it would just sound like everybody had abruptly stopped talking.

What Gurathin had said had evidently been a surprise, because voices protested, Ratthi, Volescu, and Arada mostly. Pin-Lee was saying impatiently, “There’s no danger. When it shot itself, it froze the download. I was able to remove the few fragments of rogue code that had been copied over.”

Overse began, “Do you want to do your own diagnostic, because—”

I could hear them in the room and on the security feed, so I switched to just visual on the camera. Mensah had held up a hand for quiet. She said, “Gurathin, what’s wrong?”

Gurathin said, “With it offline, I was able to use HubSystem to get some access to its internal system and log. I wanted to explore some anomalies I’d noticed through the feed.” He gestured to me. “This unit was already a rogue. It has a hacked governor module.”

On the entertainment feed, this is what they call an “oh shit” moment.

Through the security cams, I watched them be confused, but not alarmed, not yet.

Pin-Lee, who had apparently just been digging around in my local system, folded her arms. Her expression was sharp and skeptical. “I find that difficult to believe.” She didn’t add “you asshole” but it was in her voice. She didn’t like anybody questioning her expertise.

“It doesn’t have to follow our commands; there is no control over its behavior,” Gurathin said, getting impatient. He didn’t like anybody questioning his expertise either, but he didn’t show it like Pin-Lee did. “I showed Volescu my evaluations and he agrees with me.”

I had a moment to feel betrayed, which was stupid. Volescu was my client, and I’d saved his life because that was my job, not because I liked him. But then Volescu said, “I don’t agree with you.”

“The governor module is working, then?” Mensah asked, frowning at all of them.

“No, it’s definitely hacked,” Volescu explained. When he wasn’t being attacked by giant fauna, he was a pretty calm guy. “The governor’s connection to the rest of the SecUnit’s system is partially severed. It can transmit commands, but can’t enforce them or control behavior or apply punishment. But I think the fact that the Unit has been acting to preserve our lives, to take care of us, while it was a free agent, gives us even more reason to trust it.”

Okay, so I did like him.

Gurathin insisted, “We’ve been sabotaged since we got here. The missing hazard report, the missing map sections. The SecUnit must be part of that. It’s acting for the company, they don’t want this planet surveyed for whatever reason. This is what must have happened to DeltFall.”

Ratthi had been waiting for a moment to lunge in and interrupt. “Something odd is definitely going on. There were only three SecUnits for DeltFall in their specs, but there were five units in their habitat. Someone is sabotaging us, but I don’t think our SecUnit is part of it.”

With finality, Bharadwaj said, “Volescu and Ratthi are right. If the company did order the SecUnit to kill us, we would all be dead.”

Overse sounded mad. “It told us about the combat module, it told us to kill it. Why the hell would it do that if it wanted to hurt us?”

I liked her, too. And even though being part of this conversation was the last thing I wanted to do, it was time to speak for myself.

I kept my eyes closed, watching them through the security camera, because that was easier. I made myself say, “The company isn’t trying to kill you.”

That startled them. Gurathin started to speak, and Pin-Lee shushed him. Mensah stepped forward, watching me with a worried expression. She was standing near me, with Gurathin and the others gathered in a loose circle around her. Bharadwaj was farthest back, sitting in a chair. Mensah said, “SecUnit, how do you know that?”

Even through the camera, this was hard. I tried to pretend I was back in my cubicle. “Because if the company wanted to sabotage you, they would have poisoned your supplies using the recycling systems. The company is more likely to kill you by accident.”

There was a moment while they all thought about how easy it would have been for the company to sabotage its own environmental settings. Ratthi began, “But surely that would—”

Gurathin’s expression was stiffer than usual. “This Unit has killed people before, people it was charged with protecting. It killed fifty-seven members of a mining operation.”

What I told you before, about how I hacked my governor module but didn’t become a mass murderer? That was only sort of true. I was already a mass murderer.

I didn’t want to explain. I had to explain. I said, “I did not hack my governor module to kill my clients. My governor module malfunctioned because the stupid company only buys the cheapest possible components. It malfunctioned and I lost control of my systems and I killed them. The company retrieved me and installed a new governor module. I hacked it so it wouldn’t happen again.”

I think that’s what happened. The only thing I know for certain is that it didn’t happen after I hacked the module. And it makes a better story that way. I watch enough serials to know how a story like that should go.

Volescu looked sad. He shrugged a little. “My viewing of the Unit’s personal log that Gurathin obtained confirms that.”

Gurathin turned to him, impatient. “The log confirms it because that’s what the Unit believes happened.”

Bharadwaj sighed. “Yet here I sit, alive.”

The silence was worse this time. On the feed I saw Pin-Lee move uncertainly, glance at Overse and Arada. Ratthi rubbed his face. Then Mensah said quietly, “SecUnit, do you have a name?”

I wasn’t sure what she wanted. “No.”

“It calls itself ‘Murderbot,’” Gurathin said.

I opened my eyes and looked at him; I couldn’t stop myself. From their expressions I knew everything I felt was showing on my face, and I hate that. I grated out, “That was private.”

The silence was longer this time.

Then Volescu said, “Gurathin, you wanted to know how it spends its time. That was what you were originally looking for in the logs. Tell them.”

Mensah lifted her brows. “Well?”

Gurathin hesitated. “It’s downloaded seven hundred hours of entertainment programming since we landed. Mostly serials. Mostly something called Sanctuary Moon.” He shook his head, dismissing it. “It’s probably using it to encode data for the company. It can’t be watching it, not in that volume; we’d notice.”

I snorted. He underestimated me.

Ratthi said, “The one where the colony’s solicitor killed the terraforming supervisor who was the secondary donor for her implanted baby?”

Again, I couldn’t help it. I said, “She didn’t kill him, that’s a fucking lie.”

Ratthi turned to Mensah. “It’s watching it.”

Her expression fascinated, Pin-Lee asked, “But how did you hack your own governor module?”

“All the company equipment is the same.” I got a download once that included all the specs for company systems. Stuck in a cubicle with nothing to do, I used it to work out the codes for the governor module.

Gurathin looked stubborn, but didn’t say anything. I figured that was all he had, now it was my turn. I said, “You’re wrong. HubSystem let you read my log, it let you find out about the hacked governor module. This is part of the sabotage. It wants you to stop trusting me because I’m trying to keep you alive.” 

Gurathin said, “We don’t have to trust you. We just have to keep you immobilized.”

Right, funny thing about that. “That won’t work.”

“And why is that?”

I rolled off the table, grabbed Gurathin by the throat and pinned him to the wall. It was fast, too fast for them to react. I gave them a second to realize what had happened, to gasp, and for Volescu to make a little eek noise. I said, “Because HubSystem lied to you when it told you I was immobilized.”

Gurathin was red, but not as red as he would have been if I’d started applying pressure. Before anyone else could move, Mensah said, calm and even, “SecUnit, I’d appreciate it if you put Gurathin down, please.”

She’s a really good commander. I’m going to hack her file and put that in. If she’d gotten angry, shouted, let the others panic, I don’t know what would have happened.

I told Gurathin, “I don’t like you. But I like the rest of them, and for some reason I don’t understand, they like you.” Then I put him down.

I stepped away. Overse started toward him and Volescu grabbed his shoulder, but Gurathin waved them off. I hadn’t even left a mark on his neck.

I was still watching them through the camera, because it was easier than looking directly at them. My suit skin was torn, revealing some of the joins in my organic and inorganic parts. I hate that. Everyone was still frozen, shocked, uncertain. Then Mensah took a sharp breath. She said, “SecUnit, can you keep HubSystem from accessing the security recordings from this room?”

I looked at the wall next to her head. “I cut it off when Gurathin said he found out my governor module was hacked, then deleted that section. I have the visual and audio recording transfer from SecSystem to HubSystem on a five-second delay.”

“Good.” Mensah nodded. She was trying to make eye contact but I couldn’t do it right now. “Without the governor module, you don’t have to obey our orders, or anybody’s orders. But that’s been the case the entire time we’ve been here.”

The others were quiet, and I realized she was saying it for their benefit as much as mine.

She continued, “I would like you to remain part of our group, at least until we get off this planet and back to a place of safety. At that point, we can discuss what you’d like to do. But I swear to you, I won’t tell the company, or anyone outside this room, anything about you or the broken module.”

I sighed, managed to keep most of it internal. Of course she had to say that. What else could she do. I tried to decide whether to believe it or not, or whether it mattered, when I was hit by a wave of I don’t care. And I really didn’t. I said, “Okay.”

In the camera feed, Ratthi and Pin-Lee exchanged a look. Gurathin grimaced, radiating skepticism. Mensah just said, “Is there any chance HubSystem knows about your governor module?”

I hated to admit this but they needed to know. Hacking myself is one thing, but I had hacked other systems, and I didn’t know how they were going to react to that. “It might. I hacked HubSystem when we first arrived so it wouldn’t notice that the commands sent to the governor module weren’t always being followed, but if HubSystem’s been compromised by an outside agent, I don’t know if that worked. But HubSystem won’t know you know about it.”

Ratthi crossed his arms, his shoulders hunching uneasily. “We have to shut it down, or it’s going to kill us.” Then he winced and looked at me. “Sorry, I meant HubSystem.”

“No offense,” I said.

“So we think HubSystem has been compromised by an outside agent,” Bharadwaj said slowly, as if trying to convince herself. “Can we be certain it’s not the company?”

I said, “Was DeltFall’s beacon triggered?”

Mensah frowned, and Ratthi looked thoughtful again. He said, “We checked it on the way back, once we had you stabilized. It had been destroyed. So there was no reason for the attackers to do that if the company was their ally.”

Everyone stood there, quiet. I could tell from their expressions they were all thinking hard. The HubSystem that controlled their habitat, that they were dependent on for food, shelter, filtered air, and water, was trying to kill them. And in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day.

Then Arada came up and patted my shoulder. “I’m sorry. This must be very upsetting. After what that other Unit did to you . . . Are you all right?”

That was too much attention. I turned around and walked into the corner, facing away from them. I said, “There were two other instances of attempted sabotage I’m aware of. When Hostile One attacked Drs. Bharadwaj and Volescu and I went to render assistance, I received an abort command from HubSystem through my governor module. I thought it was a glitch, caused by the MedSystem emergency feed trying to override HubSystem. When Dr. Mensah was flying the little hopper to check out the nearest map anomaly, the autopilot cut out just as we were crossing over a mountain range.” I think that was it. Oh, right. “HubSystem downloaded an upgrade packet for me from the satellite before we left for DeltFall. I didn’t apply it. You should probably look at what it would have told me to do.”

Mensah said, “Pin-Lee, Gurathin, can you shut HubSystem down without compromising the environmental systems? And trigger our beacon without it interfering?”

Pin-Lee glanced at Gurathin and nodded. “It depends on what kind of condition you expect it to be in after we’re done.”

Mensah said, “Let’s say don’t blow it up, but you don’t need to be gentle, either.”

Pin-Lee nodded. “We can do that.”

Gurathin cleared his throat. “It’s going to know what we’re doing. But if it doesn’t have any instructions to stop us if we try, it may do nothing.”

Bharadwaj leaned forward, frowning. “It’s got to be reporting to someone. If it has a chance to warn them that we’re shutting it down, they could supply instructions.”

“We have to try it,” Mensah said. She nodded to them. “Get moving.”

Pin-Lee started for the door, but Gurathin said to Mensah, “Will you be all right here?”

He meant would they be all right with me here. I rolled my eyes.

“We’ll be fine,” Mensah said, firmly, with just a touch of I said now.

I watched him with the security cameras as he and Pin-Lee left, just in case he tried anything.

Volescu stirred. “We also need to look at that download from the satellite. Knowing what they wanted SecUnit to do might tell us a great deal.”

Bharadwaj pushed herself up, a little unsteadily. “MedSystem is isolated from HubSystem, correct? That’s why it hasn’t been having failures. You could use it to unpack the download.”

Volescu took her arm and they moved into the next cabin to the display surface there.

There was a little silence. The others could still listen to us on the feed, but at least they weren’t in the room, and I felt the tension in my back and shoulders relax. It was easier to think. I was glad Mensah had told them to trigger our emergency beacon. Even if some of them were still suspicious of the company, it wasn’t like there was another way off this planet. 

Arada reached over and took Overse’s hand. She said, “If it isn’t the company that’s doing this, who is it?”

“There has to be someone else here.” Mensah rubbed her forehead, wincing as she thought. “Those two extra SecUnits at DeltFall came from somewhere. SecUnit, I’m assuming the company could be bribed to conceal the existence of a third survey team on this planet.”

I said, “The company could be bribed to conceal the existence of several hundred survey teams on this planet.” Survey teams, whole cities, lost colonies, traveling circuses, as long as they thought they could get away with it. I just didn’t see how they could get away with making a client survey team—two client survey teams—vanish. Or why they’d want to. There were too many bond companies out there, too many competitors. Dead clients were terrible for business. “I don’t think the company would collude with one set of clients to kill two other sets of clients. You purchased a bond agreement that the company would guarantee your safety or pay compensation in the event of your death or injury. Even if the company couldn’t be held liable or partially liable for your deaths, they would still have to make the payment to your heirs. DeltFall was a large operation. The death payout for them alone will be huge.” And the company hated to spend money. You could tell that by looking at the recycled upholstery on the habitat’s furniture. “And if everyone believes the clients were killed by faulty SecUnits, the payment would be even bigger once all the lawsuits were filed.”

On the cameras I could see nods and thoughtful expressions as they took that in. And they remembered that I had experience in what happened after SecUnits malfunctioned and killed clients.

“So the company took a bribe to conceal this third survey group, but not to let them kill us,” Overse said. One of the good things about scientist clients is that they’re quick on the uptake. “That means we just need to stay alive long enough for the pick-up transport to get here.”

“But who is it?” Arada waved her hands. “We know whoever it is must have hacked control of the satellite.” In the security camera, I saw her look toward me. “Is that how they took control of the DeltFall SecUnits? Through a download?”

It was a good question. I said, “It’s possible. But it doesn’t explain why one of the three DeltFall Units was killed outside the hub with a mining drill.” We weren’t supposed to be able to refuse a download, and I doubted there were other SecUnits hiding hacked governor modules. “If the DeltFall group refused the download for their SecUnits because they were experiencing the same increase in equipment failure that we were, the two unidentified Units could have been sent to manually infect the DeltFall Units.”

Ratthi was staring into the distance, and through the feed I saw he was reviewing my field camera video of the DeltFall habitat. He pointed in my direction, nodding. “I agree, but it would mean the DeltFall group allowed the unknown Units into their habitat.”

It was likely. We had checked to make sure all their hoppers were there, but it had been impossible to tell if an extra one had landed and taken off again at some point. Speaking of which, I did a quick check of the security feed to see how our perimeter was doing. The drones were still patrolling and our sensor alarms all responded to pings.

Overse said, “But why? Why allow a strange group into their habitat? A group whose existence had been concealed from them?”

“You’d do it,” I said. I should keep my mouth shut, keep them thinking of me as their normal obedient SecUnit, stop reminding them what I was. But I wanted them to be careful. “If a strange survey group landed here, all friendly, saying they had just arrived, and oh, we’ve had an equipment failure or our MedSystem’s down and we need help, you would let them in. Even if I told you not to, that it was against company safety protocol, you’d do it.” Not that I’m bitter, or anything. A lot of the company’s rules are stupid or just there to increase profit, but some of them are there for a good reason. Not letting strangers into your habitat is one of them.

Arada and Ratthi exchanged a wry look. Overse conceded, “We might, yes.”

Mensah had been quiet, listening to us. She said, “I think it was easier than that. I think they said they were us.”

It was so simple, I turned around and looked directly at her. Her brow was furrowed in thought. She said, “So they land, say they’re us, that they need help. If they have access to our HubSystem, listening to our comm would be easy.”

I said, “When they come here, they won’t do that.” It all depended on what this other survey group had, whether they had come prepared to get rid of rival survey teams or had decided on it after they got here. They could have armed air vehicles, Combat SecUnits, armed drones. I pulled a few examples from the database and sent them into the feed for the humans to see.

MedSystem’s feed informed me that Ratthi, Overse, and Arada’s heart rates had just accelerated. Mensah’s hadn’t, because she had already thought of all this. It was why she had sent Pin-Lee and Gurathin to shut off HubSystem. Nervously, Ratthi said, “What do we do when they come here?”

I said, “Be somewhere else.”

It may seem weird that Mensah was the only human to think of abandoning the habitat while we waited for the beacon to bring help, but as I said before, these weren’t intrepid galactic explorers. They were people who had been doing a job and suddenly found themselves in a terrible situation.

And it had been hammered into them from the pre-trip orientation, to the waivers they had to sign for the company, to the survey packages with all the hazard information, to their on-site briefing by their SecUnit that this was an unknown, potentially dangerous region on a mostly unsurveyed planet. They weren’t supposed to leave the habitat without security precautions, and we didn’t even do overnight assessment trips. The idea that they might have to stuff both hoppers full of emergency supplies and run for it, and that that would be safer than their habitat, was hard to grasp.

But when Pin-Lee and Gurathin shut down HubSystem, and Volescu unpacked the satellite download that was meant for me, they grasped it pretty quick.

Bharadwaj outlined it for us on the comm while I was getting my last extra suit skin and my armor back on. “It was meant to take control of SecUnit, and the instructions were very specific,” she finished. “Once SecUnit was under control, it would give them access to MedSystem and SecSystem.”

I got my helmet on and opaqued it. The relief was intense, about even with finding out that the combat override module had been removed. I love you, armor, and I’m never leaving you again.

Mensah clicked onto the comm. “Pin-Lee, what about the beacon?”

“I got a go signal when I initiated launch.” Pin-Lee sounded even more exasperated than usual. “But with HubSystem shut down, I can’t get any confirmation.”

I told them over the feed that I could dispatch a drone to check on it. A good beacon launch was pretty important right now. Mensah gave me the go-ahead and I forwarded the order to one of my drones.

Our beacon was a few kilos away from our habitat site for safety, but I thought we should have been able to hear it launch. Maybe not; I had never had to launch one before. 

Mensah had already got the humans organized and moving, and as soon as I had my weapons and spare drones loaded, I grabbed a couple of crates. I kept catching little fragments of conversation over the security cameras.

(“You have to think of it as a person,” Pin-Lee said to Gurathin.

“It is a person,” Arada insisted.)

Ratthi and Arada sprinted past me carrying medical supplies and spare power cells. I had extended our drone perimeter as far as it could go. We didn’t know that whoever hit DeltFall would show up at any second, but it was a strong possibility. Gurathin had come out to check the big hopper and the little hopper’s systems, to make sure no one other than us had access and that HubSystem hadn’t messed with their code. I kept an eye on him through one of the drones. He kept looking at me, or trying not to look at me, which was worse. I didn’t need the distraction right now. When the next attack came, it was going to be fast.

(“I do think of it as a person,” Gurathin said. “An angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.”

“Then stop being mean to it,” Ratthi told him. “That might help.”)

“They know their SecUnits successfully gave our SecUnit the combat module,” Mensah was saying over the comm. “And we have to assume they received enough information from HubSystem to know we removed it. But they don’t know that we’ve theorized their existence. When SecUnit cut off HubSystem’s access, we were still assuming this was sabotage from the company. They won’t realize we know they’re coming.”

Which is why we had to keep moving. Ratthi and Arada stopped to answer a question about the medical equipment power cells and I shooed them back to the habitat for the next load.

The problem I was going to have is that the way murderbots fight is we throw ourselves at the target and try to kill the shit out of it, knowing that 90 percent of our bodies can be regrown or replaced in a cubicle. So, finesse is not required.

When we left the habitat, I wouldn’t have access to the cubicle. Even if we knew how to take it apart, which we didn’t, it was too big to fit in the hopper and required too much power.

And they might have actual combat bots rather than security bots like me. In which case, our only chance was going to be keeping away from them until the pick-up transport arrived. If the other survey group hadn’t bribed somebody in the company to delay it. I hadn’t mentioned that possibility yet.

We had everything almost loaded when Pin-Lee said on the comm, “I found it! They had an access code buried in HubSystem. It wasn’t sending them our audio or visual data, or allowing them to see our feed, but it was receiving commands periodically. That’s how it removed information from our info and map package, how it sent the command to the little hopper’s autopilot to fail.”

Gurathin added, “Both the hoppers are clear now and I’ve initiated the pre-flight checks.”

Mensah was saying something but I had just gotten an alert from SecSystem. A drone was sending me an emergency signal.

A second later I got the drone’s visual of the field where our beacon was installed. The tripod launching column was on its side, pieces of the capsule scattered around.

I pushed it out into the general feed, and the humans went quiet. In a little voice, Ratthi said, “Shit.”

“Keep moving,” Mensah said over the comm, her voice harsh.

With HubSystem down, we didn’t have any scanners up, but I had widened the perimeter as far as it would go. And SecSystem had just lost contact with one of the drones to the far south. I tossed the last crate into the cargo hold, gave the drones their orders, and yelled over the comm, “They’re coming! We need to get in the air, now!”

It was unexpectedly stressful, pacing back and forth in front of the hoppers waiting for my humans. Volescu came out with Bharadwaj, helping her over the sandy ground. Then Overse and Arada, bags slung over their shoulders, yelling at Ratthi behind them to keep up. Guranthin was already in the big hopper and Mensah and Pin-Lee came last.

They split up, Pin-Lee, Volescu, and Bharadwaj headed for the little hopper and the rest to the big one. I made sure Bharadwaj didn’t have trouble with the ramp. We had a problem at the hatch of the big hopper where Mensah wanted to get in last and I wanted to get in last. As a compromise, I grabbed her around the waist and swung us both up into the hatch as the ramp pulled in after us. I set her on her feet and she said, “Thank you, SecUnit,” while the others stared.

The helmet made it a little easier, but I was going to miss the comfortable buffer of the security cameras.

I stayed on my feet, holding on to the overhead rail, as the others got strapped in and Mensah went up to the pilot’s seat. The little hopper took off first, and she gave it time to get clear before we lifted off.

We were operating on an assumption: that since They, whoever They were, didn’t know that we knew They were here, They would only send one ship. They would be expecting to catch us in the habitat, and would probably come in prepared to destroy the hoppers to keep us there, and then start on the people. So now that we knew They were coming from the south, we were free to pick a direction. The little hopper curved away to the west, and we followed.

I just hoped their hopper didn’t have a longer range on its scanners than ours did.

I could see most of my drones on the hopper’s feed, a bright dot forming on the three dimensions of the map. Group One was doing what I’d told them, gathering at a rendezvous point near the habitat. I had a calculation going, estimating the bogie’s time of arrival. Right before we passed out of range I told the drones to head northeast. Within moments, they dropped out of my range. They would follow their last instruction until they used up their power cells.

I was hoping the other survey team would pick them up and follow. As soon as they had a visual on our habitat they’d see the hoppers were gone and know we’d run away. They might stop to search the habitat, but they also might start looking for our escape route. It was impossible to guess which.

But as we flew, curving away to the distant mountains, nothing followed us.

The humans had debated where to go. Or debated it as much as possible, while frantically calculating how much of what they might need to survive they could stuff into the hoppers. We knew the group who Ratthi was now calling EvilSurvey had had access to HubSystem and knew all the places we’d been to on assessments. So we had to go somewhere new.

We went to a spot Overse and Ratthi had proposed after a quick look at the map. It was a series of rocky hills in a thick tropical jungle, heavily occupied by a large range of fauna, enough to confuse life-sign scans. Mensah and Pin-Lee lowered the hoppers down and eased them in among rocky cliffs. I sent up some drones so we could check the view from several angles and we adjusted the hoppers’ positions a few times. Then I set a perimeter.

It didn’t feel safe, and while there were a couple of survival hut kits in the hoppers, no one suggested putting them up. The humans would stay in the hoppers for now, communicating over the comm and the hoppers’ limited feed. It wasn’t going to be comfortable for the humans (sanitary and hygiene facilities were small and limited, for one thing) but it would be more secure. Large and small fauna moved within range of our scanners, curious and potentially as dangerous as the people who wanted to kill my clients. 

I went out with some drones to do a little scouting and make sure there was no sign of anything big enough to, say, drag the little hopper off in the middle of the night. It gave me a chance to think, too.

They knew about the governor module, or the lack of it, and even though Mensah had sworn she wouldn’t report me, I had to think about what I wanted to do.

It’s wrong to think of a construct as half bot, half human. It makes it sound like the halves are discrete, like the bot half should want to obey orders and do its job and the human half should want to protect itself and get the hell out of here. As opposed to the reality, which was that I was one whole confused entity, with no idea what I wanted to do. What I should do. What I needed to do.

I could leave them to cope on their own, I guess. I pictured doing that, pictured Arada or Ratthi trapped by rogue SecUnits, and felt my insides twist. I hate having emotions about reality; I’d much rather have them about Sanctuary Moon.

And what was I supposed to do? Go off on this empty planet and just live until my power cells died? If I was going to do that I should have planned better and downloaded more entertainment media. I don’t think I could store enough to last until my power cells wore out. My specs told me that would be hundreds of thousands of hours from now.

And even to me, that sounded like a stupid thing to do.

Overse had set up some remote sensing equipment that would help warn us if anything tried to scan the area. As the humans climbed back into the two hoppers, I did a quick headcount on the feed, making sure they were all still there. Mensah waited on the ramp, indicating she wanted to talk to me in private.

I muted my feed and the comm, and she said, “I know you’re more comfortable with keeping your helmet opaque, but the situation has changed. We need to see you.”

I didn’t want to do it. Now more than ever. They knew too much about me. But I needed them to trust me so I could keep them alive and keep doing my job. The good version of my job, not the half-assed version of my job that I’d been doing before things started trying to kill my clients. I still didn’t want to do it. “It’s usually better if humans think of me as a robot,” I said.

“Maybe, under normal circumstances.” She was looking a little off to one side, not trying to make eye contact, which I appreciated. “But this situation is different. It would be better if they could think of you as a person who is trying to help. Because that’s how I think of you.”

My insides melted. That’s the only way I could describe it. After a minute, when I had my expression under control, I cleared the face plate and had it and the helmet fold back into my armor.

She said, “Thank you,” and I followed her up into the hopper.

The others were stowing the equipment and supplies that had gotten tossed in right before takeoff. “—If they restore the satellite function,” Ratthi was saying.

“They won’t chance that until—unless they get us,” Arada said.

Over the comm, Pin-Lee sighed, angry and frustrated. “If only we knew who these assholes were.”

“We need to talk about our next move.” Mensah cut through all the chatter and took a seat in the back where she could see the whole compartment. The others sat down to face her, Ratthi turning one of the mobile seats around. I sat down on the bench against the starboard wall. The feed gave us a view of the little hopper’s compartment, with the rest of the team sitting there, checking in to show they were listening. Mensah continued, “There’s another question I’d like the answer to.”

Gurathin looked at me expectantly. She isn’t talking about me, idiot.

Ratthi nodded glumly. “Why? Why are these people doing this? What is worth this to them?”

“It has to have something to do with those blanked-out sections on the map,” Overse said. She was calling up the stored images on her feed. “There’s obviously something there they want, that they didn’t want us or DeltFall to find.”

Mensah got up to pace. “Did you turn up anything in the analysis?”

In the feed, Arada did a quick consult with Bharadwaj and Volescu. “Not yet, but we hadn’t finished running all the tests. We hadn’t turned up anything interesting so far.”

“Do they really expect to get away with this?” Ratthi turned to me, like he was expecting an answer. “Obviously, they can hack the company systems and the satellite, and they intend to put the blame on the SecUnits, but . . . The investigation will surely be thorough. They must know this.”

There were too many factors in play, and too many things we didn’t know, but I’m supposed to answer direct questions and even without the governor module, old habits die hard. “They may believe the company and whoever your beneficiaries are won’t look any further than the rogue SecUnits. But they can’t make two whole survey teams disappear unless their corporate or political entity doesn’t care about them. Does DeltFall’s care? Does yours?”

That made them all stare at me, for some reason. I had to turn and look out the port. I wanted to seal my helmet so badly my organic parts started to sweat, but I replayed the conversation with Mensah and managed not to.

Volescu said, “You don’t know who we are? They didn’t tell you?”

“There was an info packet in my initial download.” I was still staring out at the heavy green tangle just past the rocks. I really didn’t want to get into how little I paid attention to my job. “I didn’t read it.”

Arada said, gently, “Why not?”

With all of them staring at me, I couldn’t come up with a good lie. “I didn’t care.”

Gurathin said, “You expect us to believe that.”

I felt my face move, my jaw harden. Physical reactions I couldn’t suppress. “I’ll try to be more accurate. I was indifferent, and vaguely annoyed. Do you believe that?”

He said, “Why don’t you want us to look at you?”

My jaw was so tight it triggered a performance reliability alert in my feed. I said, “You don’t need to look at me. I’m not a .”

Ratthi made a noise, half sigh, half snort of exasperation. It wasn’t directed at me. He said, “Gurathin, I told you. It’s shy.”

Overse added, “It doesn’t want to interact with humans. And why should it? You know how constructs are treated, especially in corporate-political environments.”

Gurathin turned to me. “So you don’t have a governor module, but we could punish you by looking at you.”

I looked at him. “Probably, right up until I remember I have guns built into my arms.”

With an ironic edge to her voice, Mensah said, “There, Gurathin. It’s threatened you, but it didn’t resort to violence. Are you satisfied now?”

He sat back. “For now.” So he had been testing me. Wow, that was brave. And very, very stupid. To me, he said, “I want to make certain you’re not under any outside compulsion.”

“That’s enough.” Arada got up and sat down next to me. I didn’t want to push past her so this pinned me in the corner. She said, “You need to give it time. It’s never interacted with humans as an openly free agent before now. This is a learning experience for all of us.” 

The others nodded, like this made sense.

Mensah sent me a private message through the feed: I hope you’re all right.

Because you need me. I don’t know where that came from. All right, it came from me, but she was my client, I was a SecUnit. There was no emotional contract between us. There was no rational reason for me to sound like a whiny human baby.

Of course I need you. I have no experience in anything like this. None of us do. Sometimes humans can’t help but let emotion bleed through into the feed. She was furious and frightened, not at me, at the people who would do this, kill like this, slaughter a whole survey team and leave the SecUnits to take the blame. She was struggling with her anger, though nothing showed on her face except calm concern. Through the feed I felt her steel herself. You’re the only one here who won’t panic. The longer this situation goes on, the others . . . We have to stay together, use our heads.

That was absolutely true. And I could help, just by being the SecUnit. I was the one who was supposed to keep everybody safe. I panic all the time, you just can’t see it, I told her. I added the text signifier for “joke.”

She didn’t answer, but she looked down, smiling to herself.

Ratthi was saying, “There’s another question. Where are they? They came toward our habitat out of the south, but that doesn’t tell us anything.”

I said, “I left three drones at our habitat. They don’t have scanning function with HubSystem down, but the visual and audio recording will still work. They may pick up something that will answer your questions.”

I’d left one drone in a tree with a long-range view of the habitat, one tucked under the extendable roof over the entrance, and one inside the hub, hidden under a console. They were on the next setting to inert, recording only, so when EvilSurvey scanned, the drones would be buried in the ambient energy readings from the habitat’s environmental system. I hadn’t been able to connect the drones to SecSystem like I normally did so it could store the data and filter out the boring parts. I knew EvilSurvey would check for that, which was why I had dumped SecSystem’s storage into the big hopper’s system and then purged it.

I also didn’t want them knowing any more about me than they already did.

Everyone was looking at me again, surprised that Murderbot had had a plan. Frankly, I didn’t blame them. Our education modules didn’t have anything like that in it, but this was another way all the thrillers and adventures I’d watched or read were finally starting to come in handy. Mensah lifted her brows in appreciation. She said, “But you can’t pick up their signal from here.”

“No, I’ll have to go back to get the data,” I told her.

Pin-Lee leaned farther into the little hopper’s camera range. “I should be able to attach one of the small scanners to a drone. It’ll be bulky and slow, but that would give us something other than just audio and visual.”

Mensah nodded. “Do it, but remember our resources are limited.” She tapped me in the feed so I’d know she was talking to me without her looking at me. “How long do you think the other group will stay at our habitat?”

There was a groan from Volescu in the other hopper. “All our samples. We have our data, but if they destroy our work—”

The others were agreeing with him, expressing frustration and worry. I tuned them out, and answered Mensah, “I don’t think they’ll stay long. There’s nothing there they want.”

For just an instant, Mensah let her expression show how worried she was. “Because they want us,” she said softly.

She was absolutely right about that, too.

Mensah set up a watch schedule, including in time for me to go into standby and do a diagnostic and recharge cycle. I was also planning to use the time to watch some Sanctuary Moon and recharge my ability to cope with humans at close quarters without losing my mind.

After the humans had settled down, either sleeping or deep in their own feeds, I walked the perimeter and checked the drones. The night was noisier than the day, but so far nothing bigger than insects and a few reptiles had come near the hoppers. When I cycled through the big hopper’s hatch, Ratthi was the human on watch, sitting up in the cockpit and keeping an eye on its scanners. I moved up past the crew section and sat next to him. He nodded to me and said, “All’s well?”

“Yes.” I didn’t want to, but I had to ask. When I was looking for permanent storage for all my entertainment downloads, the info packet was one of the files I’d purged. (I know, but I’m used to having all the extra storage on SecSystem.) Remembering what Mensah had said, I unsealed my helmet. It was easier with just Ratthi, both of us facing toward the console. “Why did everyone think it was so strange that I asked if your political entity would miss you?”

Ratthi smiled at the console. “Because Dr. Mensah is our political entity.” He made a little gesture, turning his hand palm up. “We’re from Preservation Alliance, one of the non-corporate system entities. Dr. Mensah is the current admin director on the steering committee. It’s an elected position, with a limited term. But one of the principles of our home is that our admins must also continue their regular work, whatever it is. Her regular work required this survey, so here she is, and here we are.”

Yeah, I felt a little stupid. I was still processing it when he said, “You know, in Preservation-controlled territory, bots are considered full citizens. A construct would fall under the same category.” He said this in the tone of giving me a hint.

Whatever. Bots who are “full citizens” still have to have a human or augmented human guardian appointed, usually their employer; I’d seen it on the news feeds. And the entertainment feed, where the bots were all happy servants or were secretly in love with their guardians. If it showed the bots hanging out watching the entertainment feed all through the day cycle with no one trying to make them talk about their feelings, I would have been a lot more interested. “But the company knows who she is.”

Ratthi sighed. “Oh, yes, they know. You would not believe what we had to pay to guarantee the bond on the survey. These corporate arseholes are robbers.”

It meant if we ever managed to launch the beacon, the company wouldn’t screw around, the transport would get here fast. No bribe from EvilSurvey could stop it. They might even send a faster security ship to check out the problem before the transport could arrive. The bond on a political leader was high, but the payout the company would have to make if something happened to her was off the chart. The huge payout, being humiliated in front of the other bond companies and in the news feeds . . . I leaned back in my seat and sealed my helmet to think about it.

We didn’t know who EvilSurvey was, who we were dealing with. But I bet that they didn’t either. Mensah’s status was only in the Security info packet, stored on SecSystem, which they had never gotten access to. The dueling investigations if something happened to us were bound to be thorough, as the company would be desperate for something to blame it on and the beneficiaries would be desperate to blame it on the company. Neither would be fooled long by the rogue SecUnit setup.

I didn’t see how we could use it, not right now, anyway. It didn’t comfort me and I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t comfort the humans to know the stupid company would avenge them if/when they all got murdered. 

So midafternoon the next day I got ready to take the little hopper back within range of the habitat so I could hopefully pick up intel from the drones. I wanted to go alone, but since nobody ever listens to me, Mensah, Pin-Lee, and Ratthi were going, too.

I was depressed this morning. I’d tried watching some new serials last night and even they couldn’t distract me; reality was too intrusive. It was hard not to think about how everything was going to go wrong and they were all going to die and I was going to get blasted to pieces or get another governor module stuck in me.

Gurathin walked up to me while I was doing the pre-flight, and said, “I’m coming with you.”

That was about all I needed right now. I finished the diagnostic on the power cells. “I thought you were satisfied.”

It took him a minute. “What I said last night, yes.”

“I remember every word ever said to me.” That was a lie. Who would want that? Most of it I delete from permanent memory.

He didn’t say anything. On the feed, Mensah told me that I didn’t have to take him if I didn’t want to, or if I thought it would compromise team security. I knew Gurathin was testing me again, but if something went wrong and he got killed, I wouldn’t mind as much as I would if it was one of the others. I wished Mensah, Ratthi, and Pin-Lee weren’t coming; I didn’t want to risk them. And on the long trip, Ratthi might be tempted to try to make me talk about my feelings.

I told Mensah it was fine, and we got ready to lift off.

I wanted a long time to circle west, so if EvilSurvey picked us up they wouldn’t be able to extrapolate the humans’ location from my course. By the time I was in position for the approach to the habitat, the light was failing. When we got to the target zone, it would be full dark.

The humans hadn’t gotten a lot of sleep last night, from the crowding and the strong possibility of dying. Mensah, Ratthi, and Pin-Lee had been too tired to talk much, and had fallen asleep. Gurathin was sitting in the copilot’s seat and hadn’t said a word the whole time.

We were flying in dark mode, with no lights, no transmissions. I was plugged in to the little hopper’s internal limited feed so I could watch the scans carefully. Gurathin was aware of the feed through his implant—I could feel him in there—but wasn’t using it except to keep track of where we were.

When he said, “I have a question,” I flinched. The silence up to this point had lulled me into a false sense of security.

I didn’t look at him though I knew through the feed that he was looking at me. I hadn’t closed my helmet; I didn’t feel like hiding from him. After a moment I realized he was waiting for my permission. That was weirdly new. It was tempting to ignore him, but I was wondering what the test would be this time. Something he didn’t want the others to hear? I said, “Go ahead.”

He said, “Did they punish you, for the deaths of the mining team?”

It wasn’t completely a surprise. I think they all wanted to ask about it, but maybe he was the only one abrasive enough. Or brave enough. It’s one thing to poke a murderbot with a governor module; poking a rogue murderbot is a whole different proposition.

I said, “No, not like you’re thinking. Not the way a human would be punished. They shut me down for a while, and then brought me back online at intervals.”

He hesitated. “You weren’t aware of it?”

Yeah, that would be the easy way out, wouldn’t it? “The organic parts mostly sleep, but not always. You know something’s happening. They were trying to purge my memory. We’re too expensive to destroy.”

He looked out the port again. We were flying low over trees, and I had a lot of my attention on the terrain sensors. I felt the brush of Mensah’s awareness in the feed. She must have woken when Gurathin spoke. He finally said, “You don’t blame humans for what you were forced to do? For what happened to you?”

This is why I’m glad I’m not human. They come up with stuff like this. I said, “No. That’s a human thing to do. Constructs aren’t that stupid.”

What was I supposed to do, kill all humans because the ones in charge of constructs in the company were callous? Granted, I liked the imaginary people on the entertainment feed way more than I liked real ones, but you can’t have one without the other.

The others started to stir, waking and sitting up, and he didn’t ask me anything else.

By the time we got within range, it was a cloudless night with the ring glowing in the sky like a ribbon. I had already dropped speed, and we were moving slowly over the sparse trees decorating the hills at the edge of the habitat’s plain. I had been waiting for the drones to ping me, which they would if this had worked and EvilSurvey hadn’t found them.

When I felt that first cautious touch on my feed, I stopped the hopper and dropped it down below the tree line. I landed on a hillside, the hopper’s pads extending to compensate. The humans were waiting, nervy and impatient, but no one spoke. You couldn’t see anything from here except the next hill and a lot of tree trunks.

All three drones were still active. I answered the pings, trying to keep my transmission as quick as possible. After a tense moment, the downloads started. I could tell from the timestamps that, with nobody there to instruct them not to, the drones had recorded everything from the moment I’d deployed them to now. Even though the part we were most interested in would be near the beginning, that was a lot of data. I didn’t want to stay here long enough to parse it myself, so I pushed half of it into the feed for Gurathin. Again, he didn’t say anything, just turned in his chair to lie back, close his eyes, and start reviewing it.

I checked the drone stationed outside in the tree first, running its video at high speed until I found the moment where it had caught a good image of the EvilSurvey craft.

It was a big hopper, a newer model than ours, nothing about it to cause anybody any pause. It circled the habitat a few times, probably scanning, and then landed on our empty pad.

They must know we were gone, with no air craft on the pad and no answer on their comm, so they didn’t bother to pretend to be here to borrow some tools or exchange site data. Five SecUnits piled out of the cargo pods, all armed with the big projectile weapons assigned to protect survey teams on planets with hazardous fauna, like this one. From the pattern on the armor chestplates, two were the surviving DeltFall units. They must have been put into their cubicles after we escaped the DeltFall habitat.

Three were EvilSurvey, which had a square gray logo. I focused in on it and sent it to the others. “GrayCris,” Pin-Lee read aloud.

“Ever heard of it?” Ratthi said, and the others said no.

All five SecUnits would have the combat override modules installed. They started toward the habitat, and five humans, anonymous in their color-coded field suits, climbed out of the hopper and followed. They were all armed, too, with the handweapons the company provided, that were only supposed to be used for fauna-related emergencies.

I focused as far in on the humans as the image quality would allow. They spent a lot of time scanning and checking for traps, which made me even more glad I hadn’t wasted time setting any. But there was something about them that made me think I wasn’t looking at professionals. They weren’t soldiers, any more than I was. Their SecUnits weren’t combat units, just regular security rented from the company. That was a relief. At least I wasn’t the only one who didn’t know what I was doing. 

Finally I watched them enter the habitat, leaving two SecUnits outside to guard their hopper. I tagged the section, passed it to Mensah and the others for review, and then kept watching.

Gurathin sat up suddenly and muttered a curse in a language I didn’t know. I noted it to look up later on the big hopper’s language center. Then forgot about it when he said, “We have a problem.”

I put my part of the drones’ download on pause and looked at the section he had just tagged. It was from the drone hidden in the hub.

The visual was a blurred image of a curved support strut but the audio was a human voice saying, “You knew we were coming, so I assume you have some way to watch us while we’re here.” The voice spoke standard lexicon with a flat accent. “We’ve destroyed your beacon. Come to these coordinates—” She spoke a set of longitude and latitude numbers that the little hopper helpfully mapped for me, and a time stamp. “—at this time, and we can come to some arrangement. This doesn’t have to end in violence. We’re happy to pay you off, or whatever you want.”

There was nothing else, steps fading until the door slid shut.

Gurathin, Pin-Lee, and Ratthi all started to speak at once. Mensah said, “Quiet.” They shut up. “SecUnit, your opinion.”

Fortunately, I had one now. Up to the point where we’d gotten the drone download, my opinion had been mostly oh, shit. I said, “They have nothing to lose. If we come to this rendezvous, they can kill us and stop worrying about us. If we don’t, they have until the end of project date to search for us.”

Gurathin was reviewing the landing video now. He said, “Another indication it isn’t the company. They obviously don’t want to chase us until the end of project date.”

I said, “I told you it wasn’t the company.”

Mensah interrupted Gurathin before he could respond. “They think we know why they’re here, why they’re doing this.”

“They’re wrong,” Ratthi said, frustrated.

Mensah’s brow furrowed as she picked apart the problem for the other humans. “But why do they think that? It must be because they know we went to one of the unmapped regions. That means the data we collected must have the answer.”

Pin-Lee nodded. “So the others may know by now.”

“It gives us leverage,” Mensah said thoughtfully. “But what can we do with it?”

And then I had a great idea.

So at the appointed time the next day, Mensah and I were flying toward the rendezvous point.

Gurathin and Pin-Lee had taken one of my drones and rebuilt it with a limited scanning attachment. (Limited because the drone was too small for most of the components a longer and wider range scanner would need.) Last night I had sent it into upper atmosphere to give us a view of the site.

The location was near their survey base, which was only about two kilos away, a habitat similar to DeltFall’s. By the size of their habitat and the number of SecUnits, including the one Mensah had taken out with a mining drill, they had between thirty and forty team members. They were obviously very confident, but then, they’d had access to our hub and they knew they were dealing with a small group of scientists and researchers, and one messed-up secondhand SecUnit.

I just hoped they didn’t realize how messed up I actually was.

When the hopper picked up the first blip of scanner contact, Mensah hit the comm immediately. “GrayCris, be advised that my party has secured evidence of your activities on this planet, and hidden it in various places where it will transmit to the pickup ship whenever it arrives.” She let that sink in for three seconds, then added, “You know we found the missing map sections.”

There was a long pause. I was slowing us down, scanning for incoming weapons, even though the chances were good they didn’t have any.

The comm channel came alive, and a voice said, “We can discuss our situation. An arrangement can be made.” There was so much scanning and anti-scanning going on the voice was made of static. It was creepy. “Land your vehicle and we can discuss it.”

Mensah gave it a minute, as if she was thinking it over, then answered, “I’ll send our SecUnit to speak to you.” She cut the comm off.

As we got closer we had a visual on the site. It was a low plateau, surrounded by trees. Their habitat was visible to the west. Because the trees encroached on their camp site, their domes and vehicle landing pad were elevated on wide platforms. The company required this as a security feature if you wanted your base to be anywhere without open terrain around it. It cost extra, and if you didn’t want it, it cost even more to guarantee your bond. It was one of the reasons I thought my great idea would work.

In the open area on the plateau were seven figures, four SecUnits and three humans in the color-coded enviro suits, blue, green, and yellow. It meant they had one SecUnit and probably twenty seven–plus humans back at their habitat, if they had followed the rule of one rental SecUnit per ten humans. I sat us down below the plateau, on a relatively flat rock, the view blocked by brush and trees.

I put the pilot’s console on standby, and looked at Mensah. She pressed her lips together, like she wanted to say something and was repressing the urge. Then she nodded firmly and said, “Good luck.”

I felt like I should say something to her, and didn’t know what, and just stared at her awkwardly for a few seconds. Then I sealed up my helmet and got out of the hopper as fast as I could.

I went through the trees, listening for that fifth SecUnit just in case it was hiding somewhere waiting for me, but there was no sound of movement in the undergrowth. I came out of cover and climbed the rocky slope to the plateau, then walked toward the other group, listening to the crackle on my comm. They were going to let me get close, which was a relief. I’d hate to be wrong about this. It would make me feel pretty stupid.

I stopped several meters away, opened the channel and said, “This is the SecUnit assigned to the PreservationAux Survey Team. I was sent to speak to you about an arrangement.”

I felt the pulse then, a signal bundle, designed to take over my governor module and freeze it, and freeze me. The idea was obviously to immobilize me, then insert the combat override module into my dataport again.

That was why they had had to arrange the meeting so close to their hub. They had needed the equipment there to be able to do this, it wasn’t something they could send through the feed.

So it’s a good thing my governor module wasn’t working and all I felt was a mild tickle.

One of them started toward me. I said, “I assume you’re about to try to install another combat override module and send me back to kill them.” I opened my gun ports and expanded the weapons in my arms, then folded them back in. “I don’t recommend that course of action.”

The SecUnits went into alert mode. The human who had started forward froze, then backed away. The body language of the others was flustered, startled. I could tell from the faint comm static that they were talking to each other on their own system. I said, “Anyone want to comment on that?”

That got their attention. There was no reply. Not a surprise. The only people I’ve run into who actually want to get into conversations with SecUnits are my weird humans. I said, “I have an alternate solution to both our problems.” 

The one in the blue enviro suit said, “You have a solution?” The voice was the same one who had made the offer in our hub. It was also very skeptical, which you can imagine. To them, talking to me was like talking to a hopper or a piece of mining equipment.

I said, “You weren’t the first to hack PreservationAux’s HubSystem.”

She had opened their comm channel to talk to me, and I heard one of the others whisper, “It’s a trick. One of the surveyors is telling it what to say.”

I said, “Your scans should show I’ve cut my comm.” This was the point where I had to say it. It was still hard, even though I knew I didn’t have a choice, even though it was part of my own stupid plan. “I don’t have a working governor module.” That over, I was glad to get back to the lying part. “They don’t know that. I’m amenable to a compromise that benefits you as well as me.”

The blue leader said, “Are they telling the truth about knowing why we’re here?”

That was still annoying, even though I knew we had allowed plenty of time for this part. “You used combat override modules to make the DeltFall SecUnits behave like rogues. If you think a real rogue SecUnit still has to answer your questions, the next few minutes are going to be an education for you.”

The blue leader shut me out of their comm channel. There was a long silence while they talked it over. Then she came back on, and said, “What compromise?”

“I can give you information you desperately need. In exchange, you take me onto the pick-up ship with you but list me as destroyed inventory.” That would mean nobody from the company would be expecting me back, and I could slip off in the confusion when the transport docked at the transit station. Theoretically.

There was another hesitation. Because they had to pretend to think it over, I guess. Then the blue leader said, “We agree. If you’re lying, then we’ll destroy you.”

It was perfunctory. They intended to insert a combat override module into me before they left the planet.

She continued, “What is the information?”

I said, “First remove me from the inventory. I know you still have a connection to our Hub.”

Blue Leader made an impatient gesture at Yellow. He said, “We’ll have to restart their HubSystem. That will take some time.”

I said, “Initiate the restart, queue the command, and then show me on your feed. Then I’ll give you the information.”

Blue Leader closed me out of the comm channel and spoke to Yellow again. There was a three-minute wait, then the channel opened again and I got a limited access to their feed. The command was in a queue, though of course they would have time to delete it later. The important points were that our HubSystem had been reactivated, and that I could convincingly pretend to believe them. I had been watching the time, and we were now in the target window, so there was no more reason to stall. I said, “Since you destroyed my clients’ beacon, they’ve sent a group to your beacon to manually trigger it.”

Even with limited access to their feed, I could see that got them. Body language all over the place from confusion to fear. The yellow one moved uncertainly, the green one looked at Blue Leader. In that flat accent, she said, “That’s impossible.”

I said, “One of them is an augmented human, a systems engineer. He can make it launch. Check the data you got from our HubSystem. It’s Surveyor Dr. Gurathin.”

Blue Leader was showing tension from her shoulders all down her body. She really didn’t want anybody coming to this planet, not until they had taken care of their witness problem.

Green said, “It’s lying.”

A trace of panic in his voice, Yellow said, “We can’t chance it.”

Blue Leader turned to him. “It’s possible, then?”

Yellow hesitated. “I don’t know. The company systems are all proprietary, but if they have an augmented human who can hack into it—”

“We have to go there now,” Blue Leader said. She turned to me. “SecUnit, tell your client to get out of the hopper and come here. Tell her we’ve come to an arrangement.”

All right, wow. That was not in the plan. They were supposed to leave without us.

(Last night Gurathin had said this was a weak point, that this was where the plan would fall apart. It was irritating that he was right.)

I couldn’t open my comm channel to the hopper or the hopper’s feed without GrayCris knowing. And we still needed to get them and their SecUnits away from their habitat. I said, “She knows you mean to kill her. She won’t come.” Then I had another brilliant idea and added, “She’s a planetary admin for a system noncorporate political entity, she’s not stupid.”

“What?” Green demanded. “What political entity?”

I said, “Why do you think the team is called ‘Preservation’?”

This time they didn’t bother to close their channel. Yellow said, “We can’t kill her. The investigation—”

Green added, “He’s right. We can hold her and release her after the settlement agreement.”

Blue Leader snapped, “That won’t work. If she’s missing, the investigation would be even more thorough. We need to stop that beacon launch, then we can discuss what to do.” She told me, “Go get her. Get her out of the hopper and then bring her here.” She cut the comm off again. Then one of the DeltFall SecUnits started forward. She came back on to say, “This Unit will help you.”

I waited for it to reach me, then turned and walked beside it down the slope of rock into the trees.

What I did next was predicated on the assumption that she had told the DeltFall SecUnit to kill me. If I was wrong, we were screwed, and Mensah and I would both die, and the plan to save the rest of the group would fail and PreservationAux would be back to where it started, except minus their leader, their SecUnit, and their little hopper.

As we left the rocky slope and turned into the trees, the brush and branches screening us from the edge of the plateau, I slung an arm around the other Unit’s neck, deployed my arm weapon, and fired into the side of its helmet where its comm channel was. It went down on one knee, swinging its projectile weapon toward me, energy weapons unfolding out of its armor.

With the combat override module in place, its feed was cut off, and with its comm down it couldn’t yell for help. Also, depending on how strictly they had limited its voluntary actions, it might not be able to call for help unless the GrayCris humans told it to. Maybe that was the case, because all it did was try to kill me. We rolled over rock and brush until I wrenched its weapon away. After that it was easy to finish it off. Physically easy.

I know I said SecUnits aren’t sentimental about each other, but I wished it wasn’t one of the DeltFall units. It was in there somewhere, trapped in its own head, maybe aware, maybe not. Not that it matters. None of us had a choice.

I stood up just as Mensah slammed through the brush, carrying the mining tool. I told her, “It’s gone wrong. You have to pretend to be my prisoner.”

She looked at me, then looked at the DeltFall unit. “How are you going to explain that?”

I started shedding armor, every piece that had a PreservationAux logo on it, and leaned over the DeltFall unit as the pieces dropped away. “I’m going to be it and it’s going to be me.” 

Mensah dropped the mining tool and bent down to help me. We didn’t have time to switch all the armor. Moving fast, we replaced the arm and shoulder pieces on both sides, the leg pieces that had the armor’s inventory code, the chest and back piece with the logos. Mensah smeared my remaining armor pieces with dirt and blood and fluid from the dead unit, so if we had missed anything distinctive GrayCris might not notice. SecUnits are identical in height and build, the way we moved. This might work. I don’t know. If we ran away now the plan would fail, we had to get them off this plateau. As I resealed the helmet, I told Mensah, “We have to go—”

She nodded, breathing hard, more from nerves than exertion. “I’m ready.”

I took her arm, and pretended to drag her back toward the GrayCris group. She yelled and struggled convincingly the whole way.

When we reached the plateau, a GrayCris hopper was already landing.

As I pulled her toward Blue Leader, Mensah got in the first word. She said, “So this is the arrangement you offered?”

Blue Leader said, “You’re the planetary admin of Preservation?”

Mensah didn’t look at me. If they tried to hurt her, I’d try to stop them and everything would go horribly wrong. But Green was already getting into the hopper. Two other humans were in the pilot’s and copilot’s seats. Mensah said, “Yes.”

Yellow came toward me and touched the side of my helmet. It took a tremendous effort for me not to rip his arm off, and I’d like that noted for the record, please. He said, “Its comm is down.”

To Mensah, Blue Leader said, “We know one of your people is trying to manually trigger our beacon. If you come with us, we won’t harm him, and we can discuss our situation. This doesn’t have to go badly for either of us.” She was very convincing. She had probably been the one to talk to DeltFall on the comm, asking to be let into their habitat.

Mensah hesitated, and I knew she didn’t want it to look like she was giving in too quickly, but we had to get them out of there now. She said, “Very well.”

I hadn’t ridden in the cargo container for a while. It would have been comforting and homey, except it wasn’t my cargo container.

But this hopper was still a company product and I was able to access its feed. I had to stay very quiet, to keep them from noticing me, but all those hours of surreptitiously consuming media came in handy.

Their SecSystem was still recording. They must mean to delete all that before the pick-up transport showed up. Client groups had tried that before, to hide data from the company so it couldn’t be sold out from under them, and the company systems analysts would be on the alert for it, but I don’t know if these people realized that. The company might catch them even if we didn’t survive. That wasn’t a very comforting thought.

As I accessed the ongoing recording, I heard Mensah saying, “—know about the remnants in the unmapped areas. They were strong enough to confuse our mapping functions. Is that how you found them?”

Bharadwaj had figured that out last night. The unmapped sections weren’t an intentional hack, they were an error, caused by the remnants that were buried under the dirt and rock. This planet had been inhabited at some point in its past, which meant it would be placed under interdict, open only to archeological surveys. Even the company would abide by that.

You could make big, illegal money off of excavating and mining those remnants, and that was obviously what GrayCris wanted.

“That isn’t the conversation we should be having,” Blue Leader said. “I want to know what arrangement we can come to.”

“To keep you from killing us like you did DeltFall,” Mensah said, keeping her voice even. “Once we’re in contact with our home again, we can arrange for a transfer of funds. But how can we trust you to leave us alive?”

There was a little silence. Oh great, they don’t know either. Then Blue Leader said, “You have no option except to trust us.”

We were slowing down already, coming in for a landing. There had been no alerts on the feed and I was cautiously optimistic. We had cleared the field for Pin-Lee and Gurathin as much as we could. They had had to hack the perimeter without that one last SecUnit noticing and get close enough to access the GrayCris HubSystem feed. (Hopefully it was the last SecUnit, hopefully there weren’t a dozen more somehow in the GrayCris habitat.) Gurathin had figured out how to use the hack from their HubSystem into our HubSystem to get access, but he needed to be close to their habitat to actually trigger their beacon. That was why we had to get the other SecUnits out of there. That was the idea, anyway. Possibly it would have worked without putting Mensah in danger but it was a little late to second-guess everything.

It was a relief when we thumped down into a landing that must have made the humans’ teeth rattle. I deployed out of the pod with the other units.

We were a few kilos from their habitat, on a big rock above a thick forest, lots of avians and other fauna screaming down in the trees, disturbed by the hopper’s hard landing. Clouds had come in, threatening rain, and obscuring the view of the ring. The beacon’s vehicle was in a launch tripod about ten meters away and, uh-oh, that is way too close.

I joined the three other SecUnits as we made a standard security formation. An array of drones launched from the craft to create a perimeter. I didn’t look at the humans as they walked down the ramp. I really wanted to look at Mensah for instructions. If I was alone, I could have sprinted for the end of the plateau, but I had to get her out of there.

Blue Leader stepped forward with Green; the others gathered in a loose circle behind her, like they were afraid to get in front. One, who must have been getting reports from their SecUnits and drones, said, “No sign of anybody.” Blue Leader didn’t answer but the two GrayCris SecUnits jogged toward the beacon.

Okay, the problem is, I’ve mentioned this before, the company is cheap. When it comes to something like a beacon that just has to launch once if there’s an emergency, send a transmission through the wormhole, and then never gets retrieved, they’re very cheap. Beacons don’t have safety features, and use the cheapest possible launch vehicles. There’s a reason you put them a few kilos from your habitat and trigger them from a distance. Mensah and I were supposed to distract GrayCris and their SecUnits while this was going on, get them away from the habitat, not end up as toast in the beacon launch.

With the delay caused by Blue Leader deciding to grab Mensah, time was getting close. The two SecUnits were circling the beacon’s tripod, looking for signs of tampering, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I started to walk toward Mensah.

Yellow noticed me. He must have said something to Blue Leader on their feed because she turned to look at me.

When the remaining DeltFall SecUnit whipped toward me and opened fire, I knew the light had dawned. I dove and rolled, coming up with my projectile weapon. I was taking hits all over my armor but scoring hits on the other SecUnit. Mensah ducked around the other side of the hopper and I felt a thump rattle through the plateau. That was the beacon’s primary drive, dropping out of its casing to the bottom of the tripod, getting ready to ignite. The other two SecUnits had stopped, Blue Leader’s surprise freezing them in place.

I bolted, took a hit in a weak armor joint that went through to my thigh, and powered through it. I made it around the hopper and saw Mensah. I tackled her off the edge of the rock, turning to land on my back, curling an arm over her suit helmet to protect her head from impact. We bounced off rocks and crashed through trees, then fire washed over the plateau and knocked out my— 

UNIT OFFLINE

Oh, that hurt. I was lying in a ravine, rocks and trees overhanging it. Mensah was sitting next to me, cradling an arm that looked like it didn’t work anymore and her suit was covered with tears and stains.

She was whispering to someone on the comm. “Careful, if they pick you up on their scanner—”

UNIT OFFLINE

“That’s why we need to hurry,” Gurathin said, who was suddenly standing over us. I realized I had lost some time again.

Gurathin and Pin-Lee had been on foot, making their way toward the GrayCris habitat through the cover of the forest. We had meant to go pick them up in the little hopper if everything didn’t go to shit. Which it did, but only partly, so yay for that.

Pin-Lee leaned over me and I said, “This unit is at minimal functionality and it is recommended that you discard it.” It’s an automatic reaction triggered by catastrophic malfunction. Also, I really didn’t want them to try to move me because it hurt bad enough the way it was. “Your contract allows—”

“Shut up,” Mensah snapped. “You shut the fuck up. We’re not leaving you.”

My visual cut out again. I was sort of still there, but I could tell I was hovering on the edge of a systems failure. I had flashes off and on. The inside of the little hopper, my humans talking, Arada holding my hand.

Then being in the big hopper, as it was lifting up. I could tell from the drive noise, the flashes of the feed, that the pick-up transport was bringing it onboard.

That was a relief. It meant they were all safe, and I let go.

I came back to awareness in a cubicle, the familiar acrid odor and hum of the systems as it put me back together. Then I realized it wasn’t the cubicle at the habitat. It was an older model, a permanent installation.

I was back at the company station.

And humans knew about my governor module.

I poked tentatively at it. Still nonfunctional. My media storage was still intact, too. Huh.

When the cubicle opened, Ratthi was standing there. He was wearing regular civilian station clothes, but with the soft gray jacket with the PreservationAux survey logo. He looked happy, and a lot cleaner than the last time I had seen him. He said, “Good news! Dr. Mensah has permanently bought your contract! You’re coming home with us!”

That was a surprise.

I went to finish processing, still reeling. It seemed like the kind of thing that would happen in a show, so I kept running diagnostics and checking the various available feeds to make sure I wasn’t still in the cubicle, hallucinating. There was a report running on the local station news about DeltFall and GrayCris and the investigation. If I was hallucinating, I think the company wouldn’t have managed to come out of the whole mess as the heroic rescuers of PreservationAux.

I expected a suit skin and armor, but the station units that helped us out of processing when we had catastrophic injuries gave me the gray PreservationAux survey uniform instead. I put it on, feeling weird, while the station units stood around and watched me. We’re not buddies or anything, but usually they pass along the news, what happened while you were offline, what the upcoming contracts were. I wondered if they felt as weird as I did. Sometimes SecUnits got bought in groups, complete with cubicles, by other companies. Nobody had ever come back from a survey and decided they wanted to keep their unit.

When I came out Ratthi was still there. He grabbed my arm and tugged me past a couple of human techs and out through two levels of secure doors and into the display area. This was where the rentals were arranged and it was nicer than the rest of the deployment center, with carpets and couches. Pin-Lee stood in the middle of it, dressed in sharp business attire. She looked like somebody from one of the shows I liked. The tough yet compassionate solicitor coming to rescue us from unfair prosecution. Two humans in company gear were standing around like they wanted to argue with her but she was ignoring them, tossing a data chip casually in one hand.

One saw me and Ratthi and said, “Again, this is irregular. Purging the unit’s memory before it changes hands isn’t just a policy, it’s best for the—”

“Again, I have a court order,” Pin-Lee said, grabbed my other arm, and they walked me out.

I had never seen the human parts of the station before. We went down the big multilevel center ring, past office blocks and shopping centers, crowded with every kind of people, every kind of bot, flash data displays darting around, a hundred different public feeds brushing my awareness. It was just like a place from the entertainment feed but bigger and brighter and noisier. It smelled good, too.

The thing that surprised me is that nobody stared at us. Nobody even gave us a second look. The uniform, the pants, the long-sleeved T-shirt and jacket, covered all my inorganic parts. If they noticed the dataport in the back of my neck they must have thought I was an augmented human. We were just three more people making our way down the ring. It hit me that I was just as anonymous in a crowd of humans who didn’t know each other as I was in my armor, in a group of other SecUnits.

As we turned into a hotel block I brushed a public feed offering station info. I saved a map and a set of shift schedules as we passed through the doors into the lobby.

There were potted trees twisting up into a hanging glass sculpture fountain, real, not a holo. Looking at it I almost didn’t see the reporters until they were right up on us. They were augmented humans, with a couple of drone cams. One tried to stop Pin-Lee, and instinct took over and I shouldered him off her.

He looked startled but I’d been gentle so he didn’t fall down. Pin-Lee said, “We’re not taking questions now,” shoved Ratthi into the hotel’s transport pod, then grabbed my arm and pulled me in after her.

It whooshed us around and let us out in the foyer of a big suite. I followed Pin-Lee in, Ratthi behind us talking to someone on his comm. It was just as fancy as the ones on the media, with carpets and furniture and big windows looking down on the garden and sculptures in the main lobby. Except the rooms were smaller. I guess the ones in the shows are bigger, to give them better angles for the drone cams.

My clients—ex-clients? New owners?—were here, only everybody looked different in their normal clothes.

Dr. Mensah stepped close, looking up at me. “Are you all right?”

“Yes.” I had clear pictures from my field camera of her being hurt, but all her damage had been repaired, too. She looked different, in business clothes like Pin-Lee’s. “I don’t understand what’s happening.” It was stressful. I could feel the entertainment feed out there, the same one I could access from the unit processing zone, and it was hard not to sink into it.

She said, “I’ve purchased your contract. You’re coming back to Preservation with us. You’ll be a free agent there.”

“I’m off inventory.” They had told me that and maybe it was true. I had the urge to twitch uncontrollably and I had no idea why. “Can I still have armor?” It was the armor that told people I was a SecUnit. But I wasn’t Sec anymore, just Unit.

The others were so quiet. She said, even and calm, “We can arrange that, as long as you think you need it.”

I didn’t know if I thought I needed it or not. “I don’t have a cubicle.” 

She was reassuring. “You won’t need one. People won’t be shooting at you. If you’re hurt, or your parts are damaged, you can be repaired in a medical center.”

“If people won’t be shooting at me what will I be doing?” Maybe I could be her bodyguard.

“I think you can learn to do anything you want.” She smiled. “We’ll talk about that when we get you home.”

Arada walked in then, and came over and patted my shoulder. “We’re so glad you’re with us,” she said. She told Mensah, “The DeltFall representatives are here.”

Mensah nodded. “I have to talk to them,” she told me. “Make yourself comfortable here. If there’s anything you need, tell us.”

I sat in a back corner and watched while different people came in and out of the suite to talk about what had happened. Solicitors, mostly. From the company, from DeltFall, from at least three other corporate political entities and one independent, even from GrayCris’ parent company. They asked questions, argued, looked at security records, showed Mensah and Pin-Lee security records. And they looked at me. Gurathin watched me, too, but he didn’t say anything. I wondered if he had told Mensah not to buy me.

I watched the entertainment feed a little to calm down, then pulled everything I could about the Preservation Alliance from the station’s information center. No one would be shooting at me because they didn’t shoot people there. Mensah didn’t need a bodyguard there; nobody did. It sounded like a great place to live, if you were a human or augmented human.

Ratthi came over to see if I was all right, and I asked him to tell me about Preservation and how Mensah lived there. He said when she wasn’t doing admin work, she lived on a farm outside the capital city, with two marital partners, plus her sister and brother and their three marital partners, and a bunch of relatives and kids who Ratthi had lost count of. He was called away to answer questions from a solicitor, which gave me time to think.

I didn’t know what I would do on a farm. Clean the house? That sounded way more boring than security. Maybe it would work out. This was what I was supposed to want. This was what everything had always told me I was supposed to want.

Supposed to want.

I’d have to pretend to be an augmented human, and that would be a strain. I’d have to change, make myself do things I didn’t want to do. Like talk to humans like I was one of them. I’d have to leave the armor behind.

But maybe I wouldn’t need it anymore.

Eventually things settled down, and they had dinner brought in. Mensah came and talked to me some more, about Preservation, what my options would be there, how I would stay with her until I knew what I wanted. It was pretty much what I’d already figured, from what Ratthi had told me.

“You’d be my guardian,” I said.

“Yes.” She was glad I understood. “There are so many education opportunities. You can do anything you want.”

Guardian was a nicer word than owner.

I waited until the middle of the offshift, when they were all either asleep or deep in their own feeds, working on their analysis of the assessment materials. I got up from the couch and went down the corridor, and slipped out the door.

I used the transport pod and got back to the lobby, then left the hotel. I had the map I had downloaded earlier, so I knew how to get off the ring and down toward the lower port work zones. I was wearing a survey team uniform, and passing as an augmented human, so nobody stopped me, or looked twice at me.

At the edge of the work zone, I went through into the dockworkers’ barracks, then into the equipment storage. Besides tools, the human workers had storage cubbies there. I broke into a human’s personal possessions locker and stole work boots, a protective jacket, and an enviro mask and attachments. I took a knapsack from another locker, rolled up the jacket with the survey logo and tucked it into the bag, and now I looked like an augmented human traveling somewhere. I walked out of the work zones and down the big central corridor into the port’s embarkation zone, just one of hundreds of travelers heading for the ship ring.

I checked the schedule feeds and found that one of the ships getting ready to launch was a bot-driven cargo transport. I plugged into its access from the stationside lock, and greeted it. It could have ignored me, but it was bored, and greeted me back and opened its feed for me. Bots that are also ships don’t talk in words. I pushed the thought toward it that I was a happy servant bot who needed a ride to rejoin its beloved guardian, and did it want company on its long trip? I showed it how many hours of shows and books and other media I had saved to share.

Cargo transport bots also watch the entertainment feeds, it turns out.

I don’t know what I want. I said that at some point, I think. But it isn’t that, it’s that I don’t want anyone to tell me what I want, or to make decisions for me.

That’s why I left you, Dr. Mensah, my favorite human. By the time you get this I’ll be leaving Corporation Rim. Out of inventory and out of sight.

Murderbot end message.

SecUnits don't care about the news. Even after I hacked my governor module and got access to the feeds, I never paid much attention to it. Partly because downloading the entertainment media was less likely to trigger any alarms that might be set up on satellite and station networks; political and economic news was carried on different levels, closer to the protected data exchanges. But mostly because the news was boring and I didn’t care what humans were doing to each other as long as I didn’t have to a) stop it or b) clean up after it.

But as I crossed the transit ring’s mall, a recent newsburst from Station was in the air, bouncing from one public feed to another. I skimmed it but most of my attention was on getting through the crowd while pretending to be an ordinary augmented human, and not a terrifying murderbot. This involved not panicking when anybody accidentally made eye contact with me.

Fortunately, the humans and augmented humans were too busy trying to get wherever they were going or searching the feed for directions and transport schedules. Three passenger transports had come through wormholes along with the bot-driven cargo transport I had hitched a ride on, and the big mall between the different embarkation zones was crowded. Besides the humans, there were bots of all different shapes and sizes, drones buzzing along above the crowd, and cargo moving on the overhead walkways. The security drones wouldn’t be scanning for SecUnits unless they were specifically instructed, and nothing had tried to ping me so far, which was a relief.

I was off the company’s inventory, but this was still the Corporation Rim, and I was still property.

Though I was feeling pretty great about how well I was doing so far, considering this was only the second transit ring I had been through. SecUnits were shipped to our contracts as cargo, and we never went through the parts of stations or transit rings that were meant for people. I’d had to leave my armor behind in the deployment center on Station, but in the crowd I was almost as anonymous as if I was still wearing it. (Yes, that is something I had to keep repeating to myself.) I was wearing gray and black work clothes, the long sleeves of the T-shirt and jacket, the pants and boots covering all my inorganic parts, and I was carrying a knapsack. Among the varied and colorful clothes, hair, skin, and interfaces of the crowd, I didn’t stand out. The dataport in the back of my neck was visible but the design was too close to the interfaces augmented humans often had implanted to draw any suspicion. Also, nobody thinks a murderbot is going to be walking along the transit mall like a person.

Then in my skim of the news broadcast I hit an image. It was me.

I didn’t stop in my tracks because I have a lot of practice in not physically reacting to things no matter how much they shock or horrify me. I may have lost control of my expression for a second; I was used to always wearing a helmet and keeping it opaqued whenever possible.

I passed a big archway that led to several different food service counters and stopped near the opening to a small business district. Anyone who saw me would assume I was scanning their sites in the feed, looking for information.

The image in the newsburst was of me standing in the lobby of the station hotel with Pin-Lee and Ratthi. The focus was on Pin-Lee, on her determined expression, the annoyed tilt of her eyebrows, and her sharp business clothes. Ratthi and I, in gray PreservationAux survey uniforms, were faded into the background. I was listed as “and bodyguard” in the image tags, which was a relief, but I was braced for the worst as I replayed the story.

Huh, the station I had thought of as The Station, the location of the company offices and the deployment center where I was usually stored, was actually called Port FreeCommerce. I didn’t know that. (When I was there, I was mostly in a repair cubicle, a transport box, or in standby waiting for a contract.) The news narrator mentioned in passing how Dr. Mensah had bought the SecUnit who saved her. (That was clearly the heartwarming note to relieve the otherwise grim story with the high body count.) But the journalists weren’t used to seeing SecUnits except in armor, or in a bloody pile of leftover pieces when things went wrong. They hadn’t connected the idea of a purchased SecUnit with what they assumed was the generic augmented human person going into the hotel with Pin-Lee and Ratthi. That was good.

The weird part was that some of our security recordings had been released. My vantage point, as I searched the DeltFall habitat and found the bodies. Views from Gurathin’s and Pin-Lee’s helmet cameras, when they found Mensah and what was left of me after the explosion. I scanned through it quickly, making sure there weren’t any good views of my human face.

The rest of the story was about how the company and DeltFall, plus Preservation and three other non-corporate political entities who had had citizens in DeltFall’s habitat, were ganging up on GrayCris. There was also a multi-cornered solicitor-fight going on in which some of the entities who were allies in the investigation were fighting each other over financial responsibility, jurisdiction, and bond guarantees. I didn’t know how humans could keep it all straight. There weren’t many details about what had actually happened after PreservationAux had managed to signal the company rescue transport, but it was enough to hope that anybody looking for the SecUnit in question would assume I was with Mensah and the others. Mensah and the others, of course, knew different.

Then I checked the timestamp and saw the newsburst was old, published the cycle after I had left the station. It must have come through a wormhole with one of the faster passenger transports. That meant the official news channels might have more recent info by now.

Right. I told myself there was no way anybody on this transit ring would be looking for a rogue SecUnit. From the info available in the public feed, there were no deployment centers here for any bond or security companies. My contracts had always been on isolated installations or uninhabited survey planets, and I thought that was pretty much the norm. Even the shows and serials on the entertainment feeds never showed SecUnits contracted to guard offices or cargo warehouses or shipwrights, or any of the other businesses common to transit rings. And all the SecUnits in the media were always in armor, faceless and terrifying to humans.

I merged with the crowd and started down the mall again. I had to be careful going anywhere I might be scanned for weapons, which was all the facilities for purchasing transport, including the little trams that circled the ring. I can hack a weapons scanner, but security protocols suggested that at the passenger facilities there would be a lot of them to deal with the crowds and I could only do so many at once. Plus, I would have to hack the payment system, and that sounded like way more trouble than it was worth at the moment. It was a long walk to the part of the ring for the outgoing bot-driven transports, but it gave me time to tap the entertainment feed and download new media.

On the way to this transit ring, alone on my empty cargo transport, I had had a chance to do a lot of thinking about why I had left Mensah, and what I wanted. I know, it was a surprise to me, too. But even I knew I couldn’t spend the rest of my lifespan alone riding cargo transports and consuming media, as attractive as it sounded.

I had a plan now. Or I would have a plan, once I got the answer to an important question.

To get that answer I needed to go somewhere, and there were two bot-driven transports leaving here in the next cycle that would take me there. The first was a cargo transport not unlike the one I had used to get here. It was leaving later, and was a better option, as I would have more time to get to it and talk it into letting me board. I could hack a transport if I tried, but I really preferred not to. Spending that much time with something that didn’t want you there, or that you had hacked to make it think it wanted you there, just seemed creepy. 

Maps and schedules were available in the feed, tied to all the main navigation points along the ring, so I was able to find my way down to the cargo loading area, wait for the shift change, and cut through to the embarkation zone. I had to hack an ID-screening system and some weapon-scanning drones on the level above the zone, and then got pinged by a bot guarding the entrance to the commercial area. I didn’t hurt it, just broke through its wall in the feed and deleted out of its memory any record of the encounter with me.

(I was designed to interface with company SecSystems, to be basically an interactive component of one. The safeguards on this station weren’t the company’s proprietary tech, but it was close enough. Also, nobody is as paranoid as the company about protecting the data it collects and/or steals, so I was used to security systems that were a lot more robust than this.)

Once down on the access floor, I had to be extremely careful, as there was no reason for someone not working to be here, and while most of the work was being done by hauler bots, there were uniformed humans and augmented humans here, too. More than I had counted on.

A lot of humans congregated near the lock for my prospective transport. I checked the feed for alerts and found there had been an accident involving a hauler. Various parties were sorting out the damage and who was to blame. I could have waited until they cleared out, but I wanted to get off this ring and get moving. And honestly, my image in the newsburst had rattled me and I wanted to just sink into my media downloads for a while and pretend I didn’t exist. To do that I had to be secure on a locked automated transport ready to leave the ring.

I checked the maps again for my second possibility. It was attached to a different dock, one marked for private, non-commercial traffic. If I moved fast, I could get there before it left.

The schedule had it designated as a long-range research vessel. That sounded like something that would have a crew and probably passengers, but the attached info said it was bot-driven and currently tasked with a cargo run that would stop at the destination I wanted. I had done a historical search in the feed for its movements and found it was owned by a university based on a planet in this system, which rented it out for cargo trips in between assignments to help pay for its upkeep. The trip to my destination would take twenty-one cycles, and I was really looking forward to the isolation.

Getting into the private docks from the commercial docks was easy. I got control of the security system long enough to tell it not to notice that I didn’t have authorization, and walked through behind a group of passengers and crew members.

I found the research transport’s dock, and pinged it through the comm port. It pinged back almost immediately. All the info I had managed to pull off the feed said it was prepared for an automated run, but just to be sure I sent a hail for attention from human crew. The answer came back a null, no one home.

I pinged the transport again and gave it the same offer I had given the first transport: hundreds of hours of media, serials, books, music, including some new shows I had just picked up on the way through the transit mall, in exchange for a ride. I told it I was a free bot, trying to get back to its human guardian. (The “free bot” thing is deceptive. Bots are considered citizens in some non-corporate political entities like Preservation, but they still have appointed human guardians. Constructs sometimes fall under the same category as bots, sometimes under the same category as deadly weapons. (FYI, that is not a good category to be in.)) This is why I had been a free agent among humans for less than seven cycles, including time spent alone on a cargo transport, and I already needed a vacation.

There was a pause, then the research transport sent an acceptance and opened the lock for me.

I waited to make sure the lock cycled closed, and that there were no alarms from the ringside, then went down the access corridor. From the schematic available in the shipboard feed, the compartments the transport was using for cargo were normally modular lab space. With the labs sealed and removed to the university’s dock storage, there was plenty of room for cargo. I pushed my condensed packet of media into the transport’s feed for it to take whenever it wanted.

The rest of the space was the usual engineering, supply storage, cabins, medical, mess hall, with the addition of a larger recreation area and some teaching suites. There was blue and white padding on the furniture and it had all been cleaned recently, though it still had a trace of that dirty sock smell that seems to hang around all human habitations. It was quiet, except for the faint noise of the air system, and my boots weren’t making any sound on the deck covering.

I didn’t need supplies. My system is self-regulating; I don’t need food, water, or to eliminate fluids or solids, and I don’t need much air. I could have lasted on the minimal life support that was all that was provided when no people were aboard, but the transport had upped it a little. I thought that was nice of it.

I wandered around, visually checking things out to see that it matched the schematic, and just making sure everything was okay. I did it, even knowing that patrolling was a habit I was going to have to get over. There were a lot of things I was going to have to get over.

When constructs were first developed, they were originally supposed to have a pre-sentient level of intelligence, like the dumber variety of bot. But you can’t put something as dumb as a hauler bot in charge of security for anything without spending even more money for expensive company-employed human supervisors. So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.

In the deployment center, when I was standing there while Dr. Mensah explained why she didn’t want to rent me as part of the bond guarantee agreement, she had called the increase in intelligence a “hellish compromise.”

This ship was not my responsibility and there were no human clients aboard that I had to keep anything from hurting, or keep from hurting themselves, or keep from hurting each other. But this was a nice ship with surprisingly little security, and I wondered why the owners didn’t leave a few humans aboard to keep an eye on it. Like most bot-driven transports, the schematics said there were drones onboard to make repairs, but still.

I kept patrolling until I felt the rumble and clunk through the deck that meant the ship had just decoupled itself from the ring and started to move. The tension that had kept me down to 96 percent capacity eased; a murderbot’s life is stressful in general, but it would be a long time before I got used to moving through human spaces with no armor, no way to hide my face.

I found a crew meeting area below the control deck and planted myself in one of the padded chairs. Repair cubicles and transport boxes don’t have padding, so traveling in comfort was still a novelty. I started sorting through the new media I’d downloaded on the transit ring. It had some entertainment channels that weren’t available on the company’s portion of Port FreeCommerce, and they included a lot of new dramas and action series.

I’d never really had long periods of unobserved free time before. The leisure to sort through everything and get it organized, and give it my full attention, without having to monitor multiple systems and the clients’ feeds, was still something I was getting used to. Before this, I’d either been on duty, on call, or stuck in a cubicle on standby waiting to be activated for a contract.

I chose a new serial that looked interesting (the tags promised extragalactic exploration, action, and mysteries) and started the first episode. I was ready to settle in until it was time to think about what I was going to do when I got to my destination, something I intended to put off until the last possible moment. Then, through my feed, something said, You were lucky. 

I sat up. It was so unexpected, I had an adrenaline release from my organic parts.

Transports don’t talk in words, even through the feed. They use images and strings of data to alert you to problems, but they’re not designed for conversation. I was okay with that, because I wasn’t designed for conversation, either. I had shared my stored media with the first transport, and it had given me access to its comm and feed streams so I could make sure no one knew where I was, and that had been the extent of our interaction.

I poked cautiously through the feed, wondering if I’d been fooled. I had the ability to scan, but without drones my range was limited, and with all the shielding and equipment around me I couldn’t pick up anything but background readings from the ship’s systems. Whoever owned the ship wanted to allow for proprietary research; the only security cameras were on the hatches, nothing in the crew areas. Or nothing I could access. But the presence in the feed was too big and diffuse for a human or augmented human, I could tell that much even through the feed walls protecting it. And it sounded like a bot. When humans speak in the feed, they have to subvocalize and their mental voice tends to sound like their physical voice. Even augmented humans with full interfaces do it.

Maybe it was trying to be friendly and was just awkward at communicating. I said aloud, “Why am I lucky?”

That no one realized what you were.

That was less than reassuring. I said, cautiously, “What do you think I am?” If it was hostile, I didn’t have a lot of options. Transport bots don’t have bodies, other than the ship. The equivalent of its brain would be above me, near the bridge where the human flight crew would be stationed. And it wasn’t like I had anywhere to go; we were moving out from the ring and making leisurely progress toward the wormhole.

It said, You’re a rogue SecUnit, a bot/human construct, with a scrambled governor module. It poked me through the feed and I flinched. It said, Do not attempt to hack my systems, and for .00001 of a second it dropped its wall.

It was enough time for me to get a vivid image of what I was dealing with. Part of its function was extragalactic astronomic analysis and now all that processing power sat idle while it hauled cargo, waiting for its next mission. It could have squashed me like a bug through the feed, pushed through my wall and other defenses and stripped my memory. Probably while also plotting its wormhole jump, estimating the nutrition needs of a full crew complement for the next 66,000 hours, performing multiple neural surgeries in the medical suite, and beating the captain at tavla. I had never directly interacted with anything this powerful before.

You made a mistake, Murderbot, a really bad mistake. How the hell was I supposed to know there were transports sentient enough to be mean? There were evil bots on the entertainment feed all the time, but that wasn’t real, it was just a scary story, a fantasy.

I’d thought it was a fantasy.

I said, “Okay,” shut down my feed, and huddled down into the chair.

I’m not normally afraid of things, the way humans are. I’ve been shot hundreds of times, so many times I stopped keeping count, so many times the company stopped keeping count. I’ve been chewed on by hostile fauna, run over by heavy machinery, tortured by clients for amusement, memory purged, etc., etc. But the inside of my head had been my own for +33,000 hours and I was used to it now. I wanted to keep me the way I was.

The transport didn’t respond. I tried to come up with countermeasures for all the different ways it could hurt me and how I could hurt it back. It was more like a SecUnit than a bot, so much so I wondered if it was a construct, if there was cloned organic brain tissue buried in its systems somewhere. I’d never tried to hack another SecUnit. It might be safest to go into standby for the duration of the trip, and trigger myself to wake when we reached my destination. Though that would leave me vulnerable to its drones.

I watched seconds click by, waiting to see if it reacted. I was glad I had noted the lack of cameras and not bothered trying to hack into the ship’s security system. I understood now why the humans felt it didn’t need additional protection. A bot with this complete control over its environment and the initiative and freedom to act could repel any attempt to board.

It had opened the hatch for me. It wanted me here.

Uh-oh.

Then it said, You can continue to play the media.

I just huddled there warily.

It added, Don’t sulk.

I was afraid, but that made me irritated enough to show it that what it was doing to me was not exactly new. I sent through the feed, SecUnits don’t sulk. That would trigger punishment from the governor module, and attached some brief recordings from my memory of what exactly that felt like.

Seconds added up to a minute, then another, then three more. It doesn’t sound like much to humans, but for a conversation between bots, or excuse me, between a bot/human construct and a bot, it was a long time.

Then it said, I’m sorry I frightened you.

Okay, well. If you think I trusted that apology, you don’t know Murderbot. Most likely it was playing a game with me. I said, “I don’t want anything from you. I just want to ride to your next destination.” I’d explained that earlier, before it opened the hatch for me, but it was worth repeating.

I felt it withdraw back behind its wall. I waited, and let my circulatory system purge the fear-generated chemicals. More time crawled by, and I started to get bored. Sitting here like this was too much like waiting in a cubicle after I’d been activated, waiting for the new clients to take delivery, for the next boring contract. If it was going to destroy me, at least I could get some media in before that happened. I started the new show again, but I was still too upset to enjoy it, so I stopped it and started rewatching an old episode of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.

After three episodes, I was calmer and reluctantly beginning to see the transport’s perspective. A SecUnit could cause it a lot of internal damage if it wasn’t careful, and rogue SecUnits were not exactly known for lying low and avoiding trouble. I hadn’t hurt the last transport I had taken a ride on, but it didn’t know that. I didn’t understand why it had let me aboard, if it really didn’t want to hurt me. I wouldn’t have trusted me, if I was a transport.

Maybe it was like me, and it had taken an opportunity because it was there, not because it knew what it wanted.

It was still an asshole, though.

Six episodes later I felt the transport in the feed again, lurking. I ignored it, though it had to know I knew it was there. In human terms, it was like trying to ignore someone large and breathing heavily while they watched your personal display surface over your shoulder. While leaning on you.

I watched seven more episodes of Sanctuary Moon with it hanging around my feed. Then it pinged me, like I somehow might not know it had been in my feed all this time, and sent me a request to go back to the new adventure show I had started to watch when it had interrupted me.

(It was called Worldhoppers, and was about freelance explorers who extended the wormhole and ring networks into uninhabited star systems. It looked very unrealistic and inaccurate, which was exactly what I liked.)

“I gave you a copy of all my media when I came aboard,” I said. I wasn’t going to talk to it through the feed like it was my client. “Did you even look at it?”

I examined it for viral malware and other hazards. 

And fuck you, I thought, and went back to Sanctuary Moon.

Two minutes later it repeated the ping and the request.

I said, “Watch it yourself.”

I tried. I can process the media more easily through your filter.

That made me stop. I didn’t understand the problem.

It explained, When my crew plays media, I can’t process the context. Human interactions and environments outside my hull are largely unfamiliar.

Now I understood. It needed to read my reactions to the show to really understand what was happening. Humans used the feed in different ways than bots (and constructs) so when its crew played their media, their reactions didn’t become part of the data.

I found it odd that the transport was less interested in Sanctuary Moon, which took place on a colony, than Worldhoppers, which was about the crew of a large exploration ship. You’d think it would be too much like work—I avoided serials about survey teams and mining installations—but maybe familiar things were easier for it.

I was tempted to say no. But if it needed me to watch the show it wanted, then it couldn’t get angry and destroy my brain. Also, I wanted to watch the show, too.

“It’s not realistic,” I told it. “It’s not supposed to be realistic. It’s a story, not a documentary. If you complain about that, I’ll stop watching.”

I will refrain from complaint, it said. (Imagine that in the most sarcastic tone you can, and you’ll have some idea of how it sounded.)

So we watched Worldhoppers. It didn’t complain about the lack of realism. After three episodes, it got agitated whenever a minor character was killed. When a major character died in the twentieth episode I had to pause seven minutes while it sat there in the feed doing the bot equivalent of staring at a wall, pretending that it had to run diagnostics. Then four episodes later the character came back to life and it was so relieved we had to watch that episode three times before it would go on.

At the climax of one of the main story lines, the plot suggested the ship might be catastrophically damaged and members of the crew killed or injured, and the transport was afraid to watch it. (That’s obviously not how it phrased it, but yeah, it was afraid to watch it.) I was feeling a lot more charitable toward it by that point so was willing to let it ease into the episode by watching one to two minutes at a time.

After it was over, it just sat there, not even pretending to do diagnostics. It sat there for a full ten minutes, which is a lot of processing time for a bot that sophisticated. Then it said, Again, please.

So I started the first episode again.

After two more run-throughs of Worldhoppers, it wanted to see every other show I had about humans in ships. Though after we encountered one based on a true story, where the ship experienced a hull breach and decompression killed several members of the crew (permanently, this time), it got too upset and I had to create a content filter. To give it a break, I suggested Sanctuary Moon. It agreed.

After four episodes, it asked me, There are no SecUnits in this story?

It must have thought that Sanctuary Moon was my favorite for the same reason that it liked Worldhoppers. I said, “No. There aren’t that many shows with SecUnits, and they’re either villains or the villain’s minions.” The only SecUnits in entertainment media were rogues, out to kill all humans because they forgot who built the repair cubicles, I guess. In some of the worst shows, SecUnits would sometimes have sex with the human characters. This was weirdly inaccurate and also anatomically complicated. Constructs with intercourse-related human parts are s, not SecUnits. s don’t have interior weapon systems, so it isn’t like it’s easy to confuse them with SecUnits. (SecUnits also have less than null interest in human or any other kind of sex, trust me on that.)

Granted, it would have been hard to show realistic SecUnits in visual media, which would involve depicting hours of standing around in brain-numbing boredom, while your nervous clients tried to pretend you weren’t there. But there weren’t any depictions of SecUnits in books, either. I guess you can’t tell a story from the point of view of something that you don’t think has a point of view.

It said, The depiction is unrealistic.

(You know, just imagine everything it says in the most sarcastic tone possible.)

“There’s unrealistic that takes you away from reality and unrealistic that reminds you that everybody’s afraid of you.” In the entertainment feed, SecUnits were what the clients expected: heartless killing machines that could go rogue at any second, for no reason, despite the governor modules.

The transport thought that over for 1.6 seconds. In a less sarcastic tone, it said, You dislike your function. I don’t understand how that is possible.

Its function was traveling through what it thought of as the endlessly fascinating sensation of space, and keeping all its human and otherwise passengers safe inside its metal body. Of course it didn’t understand not wanting to perform your function. Its function was great.

“I like parts of my function.” I liked protecting people and things. I liked figuring out smart ways to protect people and things. I liked being right.

Then why are you here? You are not a “free bot” looking for your guardian, who presumably cannot simply be sent a message via the public comm relay on the transit ring we recently departed.

The question caught me by surprise, because I hadn’t thought it was interested in anything besides itself. I hesitated, but it already knew I was a SecUnit, and it already knew there was just no circumstance where it was legal and okay that I was here. It might as well know who I was. I sent my copy of the Port FreeCommerce newsburst into the feed. “That’s me.”

Dr. Mensah of PreservationAux purchased you and allowed you to leave?

“Yes. Do you want to watch WorldHoppers again?” I regretted the question an instant later. It knew that was an attempt at a distraction.

But it said, I am not allowed to accept unauthorized passengers or cargo, and have had to alter my log to hide any evidence of your presence. There was a hesitation. So we both have a secret.

I had no reason not to tell it, except fear of sounding stupid. “I left without permission. She offered me a home with her on Preservation, but she doesn’t need me there. They don’t need SecUnits there. And I … didn’t know what I wanted, if I wanted to go to Preservation or not. If I want a human guardian, which is just a different word for owner. I knew it would be easier to escape from the station than it would from a planet. So I left. Why did you let me onboard?”

I thought maybe I could distract it by getting it to talk about itself. Wrong again. It said, I was curious about you, and cargo runs are tedious without passengers. You left to travel to RaviHyral Mining Facility Q Station. Why?

“I left to get off Port FreeCommerce, away from the company.” It waited. “After I had a chance to think, I decided to go to RaviHyral. I need to research something, and that’s the best place to do it.”

I thought the mention of research might stop its questions, since it understood research. No, not so much. There were public library feeds available on the transit ring, with information exchange to the planetary archives. Why not do the research there? My onboard archives are extensive. Why haven’t you sought access to them?

I didn’t answer. It waited thirty whole seconds, then it said, The systems of constructs are inherently inferior to advanced bots, but you aren’t stupid. 

Yeah, well, fuck you, too, I thought, and initiated a shutdown sequence.

I jolted awake four hours later, when my automatic recharge cycle started. The transport said immediately, That was unnecessarily childish.

“What do you know about children?” I was even more angry now because it was right. The shutdown and the time I had spent inert would have driven off or distracted a human; the transport had just waited to resume the argument.

My crew complement includes teachers and students. I have accumulated many examples of childishness.

I just sat there, fuming. I wanted to go back to watching media, but I knew it would think it meant I was giving in, accepting the inevitable. For my entire existence, at least the parts I could remember, I had done nothing but accept the inevitable. I was tired of it.

We are friends now. I don’t understand why you won’t discuss your plans.

It was such an astonishing, infuriating statement. “We aren’t friends. The first thing you did when we were underway was threaten me,” I pointed out.

I needed to make certain you didn’t attempt to harm me.

I noticed it had said “attempt” and not “intend.” If it had cared anything about my intentions it wouldn’t have let me onboard in the first place. It had enjoyed showing me it was more powerful than a SecUnit.

Not that it was wrong about the “attempt.” While watching the episodes I had managed to do some analysis of it, using the schematics in its own public feed and the specs of similar transports available on the unsecured sections of its database. I had figured out twenty-seven different ways to render it inoperable and three to blow it up. But a mutually assured destruction scenario was not something I was interested in.

If I got through this intact, I needed to find a nicer, dumber transport for the next ride.

I hadn’t responded and I knew by now it couldn’t stand that. It said, I apologized. I still didn’t respond. It added, My crew always considers me trustworthy.

I shouldn’t have let it watch all those episodes of Worldhoppers. “I’m not your crew. I’m not a human. I’m a construct. Constructs and bots can’t trust each other.”

It was quiet for ten precious seconds, though I could tell from the spike in its feed activity it was doing something. I realized it must be searching its databases, looking for a way to refute my statement. Then it said, Why not?

I had spent so much time pretending to be patient with humans asking stupid questions. I should have more self-control than this. “Because we both have to follow human orders. A human could tell you to purge my memory. A human could tell me to destroy your systems.”

I thought it would argue that I couldn’t possibly hurt it, which would derail the whole conversation.

But it said, There are no humans here now.

I realized I had been trapped into this conversational dead end, with the transport pretending to need this explained in order to get me to articulate it to myself. I didn’t know who I was more annoyed at, myself or it. No, I was definitely more annoyed at it.

I sat there for a while, wanting to go back to the media, any media, rather than think about this. I could feel it in the feed, waiting, watching me with all its attention except for the miniscule amount of awareness it needed to keep itself on course.

Did it really matter if it knew? Was I afraid knowing would change its opinion of me? (As far as I could tell, its opinion was already pretty low.) Did I really care what an asshole research transport thought about me?

I shouldn’t have asked myself that question. I felt a wave of non-caring about to come over me, and I knew I couldn’t let it. If I was going to follow my plan, such as it was, I needed to care. If I let myself not care, then there was no telling where I’d end up. Riding dumb transports watching media until somebody caught me and sold me back to the company, probably, or killed me for my inorganic parts.

I said, “At some point approximately 35,000 hours ago, I was assigned to a contract on RaviHyral Mining Facility Q Station. During that assignment, I went rogue and killed a large number of my clients. My memory of the incident was partially purged.” SecUnit memory purges are always partial, due to the organic parts inside our heads. The purge can’t wipe memory from organic neural tissue. “I need to know if the incident occurred due to a catastrophic failure of my governor module. That’s what I think happened. But I need to know for sure.” I hesitated, but what the hell, it already knew everything else. “I need to know if I hacked my governor module in order to cause the incident.”

I don’t know what I expected. I knew ART (aka Asshole Research Transport) had a deeper attachment to its crew than SecUnits had for clients. If it didn’t feel that way about the humans it carried and worked with, then it wouldn’t have gotten so upset whenever anything happened to the characters on Worldhoppers. I wouldn’t have had to filter out all the based-on-a-true-story shows where human crews got hurt. I knew what it felt, because I felt that way about Mensah and PreservationAux.

It said, Why was your memory of the incident purged?

That wasn’t the question I was expecting. “Because SecUnits are expensive and the company didn’t want to lose any more money on me than it already had.” I wanted to fidget. I wanted to say something so offensive to it that it would leave me alone. I really wanted to stop thinking about this and watch Sanctuary Moon. “Either I killed them due to a malfunction and then hacked the governor module, or I hacked the governor module so I could kill them,” I said. “Those are the only two possibilities.”

Are all constructs so illogical? said the Asshole Research Transport with the immense processing capability whose metaphorical hand I had had to hold because it had become emotionally compromised by a fictional media serial. Before I could say that, it added, Those are not the first two possibilities to consider.

I had no idea what it meant. “All right, what are the first two possibilities to consider?”

That it either happened, or it didn’t.

I had to get up and pace.

Ignoring me, ART continued, If it happened, did you cause it to happen, or did an outside influence use you to cause it to happen? If an outside influence caused it to happen, why? Who benefited from the incident?

ART seemed happy to have the problem laid out so clearly. I wasn’t sure I was. “I know I could have hacked my governor module.” I pointed at my head. “Hacking my governor module is why I’m here.”

If your ability to hack your governor module was what caused the incident, why was it not checked periodically and the current hack detected?

There would be no point in hacking the module if I couldn’t fool the standard diagnostics. But … The company was cheap and sloppy, but not stupid. I had been kept in a deployment center attached to corporate offices. So they hadn’t anticipated any potential danger.

ART said, You are correct that further research is called for before the incident can be understood fully. How do you plan to proceed?

I stopped pacing. It knew how I planned to proceed. Go to RaviHyral, look for information. There hadn’t been anything in the company’s knowledge base that I could access without getting caught, but the systems on RaviHyral itself might not be so well protected. And maybe if I saw the place again, it would spark something in my human neural tissue. (I wasn’t much looking forward to that part, if it happened.) I could tell ART was doing that thing again where it asked me questions it knew the answer to so it could trap me into admitting stuff that I didn’t want to admit. I decided to just skip to the end. “What do you mean?” 

You will be identified as a SecUnit.

That stung a little. “I can pass as an augmented human.” Augmented humans are still considered humans. I don’t know if there are any augmented humans with enough implants to resemble a SecUnit. It seems unlikely a human would want that many implants, or would survive whatever catastrophic injury might make them necessary. But humans are weird. Whatever, I didn’t intend to let anyone see more than I absolutely had to.

You look like a SecUnit. You move like a SecUnit. It sent a whole array of images into the feed, comparing a recording of me moving around its corridors and cabins with recordings of various members of its crew in the same spaces. I had relaxed, relieved to be off the transit ring, but I didn’t look very relaxed. I looked like a patrolling SecUnit.

“No one noticed on the transit rings,” I said. I knew I was taking a chance. I had gotten by so far because the humans and augmented humans in the commercial transport rings didn’t see SecUnits except on the entertainment feed or in the news, where we were mostly killing people or already blasted into pieces. If I was spotted by anyone who had ever worked a long-term contract with SecUnits, there was a good chance they would realize what I was.

ART brought up a map listing. The RaviHyral Mining Facility Q Station was the third largest moon of a gas giant. The map rotated, with the various mining installations and support centers and the port highlighted. There was only the one port. These installations will employ SecUnits/have employed SecUnits. You will be seen by human authorities who have worked with SecUnits.

I hate it when ART is right. “I can’t do anything about that.”

You can’t alter your configuration.

I could see the skepticism through the feed. “No, I can’t. Look up the specs on SecUnits.”

SecUnits are never altered. Skepticism intensifying. It had obviously pulled all the information on SecUnits in its database and assimilated it.

“No. s are altered.” At least the ones I had seen had been altered. Some were mostly Unit standard with a few changes, others were radically different. “But that’s done in the deployment center, in the repair cubicles. To do anything like that I’d need a medical suite. A full one, not just an emergency kit.”

It said, I have a full medical suite. Alterations can be made there.

That was true, but even a medical suite as good as what ART had, able to carry out thousands of unassisted procedures on humans, wouldn’t have the programming to physically alter a SecUnit. I might be able to guide it through the process, but there was a big problem with that. Alterations to my organic and nonorganic components would cause catastrophic function loss if I wasn’t deactivated when they took place. “Theoretically. But I can’t operate the medical suite while I’m being altered.”

I can.

I didn’t say anything. I started sorting through my media again.

Why are you not responding?

I knew ART well enough by now to know it wouldn’t leave me alone, so I went ahead and spelled it out. “You want me to trust you to alter my configuration while I’m inactive? When I’m helpless?”

It had the audacity to sound offended. I assist my crew in many procedures.

I got up, paced, stared at the bulkhead for two minutes, then ran a diagnostic. Finally, I said, “Why do you want to help me?”

I’m accustomed to assisting my crew with large-scale data analysis, and numerous other experiments. While I am in transport mode, I find my unused capacity tiresome. Solving your problems is an interesting exercise in lateral thinking.

“So you’re bored? I’d be the best toy you’ve ever had?” When I was on inventory, I would have given anything for twenty-one cycles of unobserved downtime. I couldn’t feel sorry for ART. “If you’re bored, watch the media I gave you.”

I am aware that for you, your survival as a rogue Unit would be at stake.

I started to correct it, then stopped. Rogue was not how I thought of myself. I had hacked my governor module but continued to obey orders, at least most of them. I had not escaped from the company; Dr. Mensah had legally bought me. While I had left the hotel without her permission, she hadn’t told me not to leave, either. (Yes, I know the last one isn’t helping the argument all that much.)

Rogue units killed their human and augmented human clients. I … had done that once. But not voluntarily.

I needed to find out whether or not it had been voluntary.

“My survival isn’t at stake if I continue to ride unoccupied transports.” And learn to avoid the asshole ones that want to threaten me and question all my choices and try to talk me into getting into the medical suite so they could do experimental surgery on me.

Is that all you want? You don’t want to return to your crew?

I said, not patiently, “I don’t have a crew.”

It sent me an image from the newsburst I had given it, a group image of PreservationAux. Everybody was in their gray uniforms, smiling, for a team portrait taken at the start of the contract. That isn’t your crew?

I didn’t know how to answer it.

I had spent thousands of hours watching or reading about, and liking, groups of fictional humans in the media. Then I had ended up with a group of real humans to watch and like, and then somebody tried to kill them, and while protecting them I had to tell them I had hacked my governor module. So I left. (Yes, I know it’s more complicated than that.)

I tried to think about why I didn’t want to change my configuration, even to help protect myself. Maybe because it was something humans did to s. I was a murderbot, I had to have higher standards?

I didn’t want to look more human than I already did. Even when I was still in armor, once my PreservationAux clients had seen my human face, they had wanted to treat me like a person. Make me ride in the crew section of the hopper, bring me in for their strategy meetings, talk to me. About my feelings. I couldn’t take that.

But I didn’t have the armor anymore. My appearance, my ability to pass as an augmented human, had to be my new armor. It wouldn’t work if I couldn’t pass among humans who were familiar with SecUnits.

But that seemed pointless, and I felt another wave of “I don’t care” coming on. Why should I care? I liked humans, I liked watching them on the entertainment feed, where they couldn’t interact with me. Where it was safe. For me and for them.

If I had gone back to Preservation with Dr. Mensah and the others, she might be able to guarantee my safety, but could I really guarantee her safety from me?

Altering my physical configuration still seemed drastic. But hacking my governor module was drastic. Leaving Dr. Mensah was drastic.

ART said, almost plaintively, I don’t understand why this is a difficult choice.

I didn’t, either, but I wasn’t going to tell it that.

I took two cycles to think it over. I didn’t talk to ART about it, or anything else, though we kept watching media together, and it exercised a self-restraint I didn’t think it had and didn’t try to start arguments with me.

I knew I had been lucky up to this point. Onboard the transport I had used to leave Port FreeCommerce, I had compared myself to recordings of humans, trying to isolate what factors might cause me to be identified as a SecUnit. The most correctable behavior was restless movement. Humans and augmented humans shift their weight when they stand, they react to sudden sounds and bright lights, they scratch themselves, they adjust their hair, they look in their pockets or bags to check for things that they already know are in there. 

SecUnits don’t move. Our default is to stand and stare at the things we’re guarding. Partly this is because our non-organic parts don’t need movement the way organic parts do. But mostly it’s because we don’t want to draw attention to ourselves. Any unusual movement might cause a human to think there’s something wrong with you, which will draw more scrutiny. If you’ve gotten stuck with one of the bad contracts, it might cause the humans to order the HubSystem to use your governor module to immobilize you.

After analyzing human movement, I wrote some code for myself, to cause me to make a random series of movements periodically if I was standing still. To change my respiration to react to changes in the air quality. To vary my walking speed, to make sure I reacted to stimuli physically instead of just scanning and noting it. This code had gotten me through the second transit ring. But would I be all right on a ring or installation frequented by humans who often saw or worked with SecUnits?

I tweaked my code a little and asked ART to record me again as I moved around its corridors and compartments. I tried to make myself look as much like a human as possible. I’m used to feeling mentally awkward around humans, and I took that sensation and tried to express it in my physical movements. I felt pretty good about the result. Until I looked at the recordings and compared them to ART’s recordings of its crew and my recordings of other SecUnits.

The only one I was fooling here was myself.

The change in movement made me look more human but my proportions exactly matched the other SecUnits. I was good enough to fool humans who weren’t looking for me, since humans tend to ignore non-standard behavior in transitional public spaces. But anyone who had set out to find me, who was alert to the possibility of a rogue SecUnit, might not be fooled, and a simple scan calibrated to search for SecUnit size, height, and weight was certain to find me.

It was the logical choice, it was the obvious choice, and I would still rather peel my human skin off than do it.

I was going to have to do it.

After a lot of argument, we agreed the easiest change for the best result was to take two centimeters of length out of my legs and arms. It doesn’t sound like a big change, but it meant my physical proportions would no longer match Unit standard. It would change the way I walked, the way I moved. It made sense and I was fine with it.

Then ART said we also needed to change the code controlling my organic parts, so they could grow hair.

My first reaction to that was no fucking way. I had hair on my head, and eyebrows; that was a part of SecUnit configuration that was shared with s, though the code controlling it kept SecUnit head hair short to keep it from interfering with the armor. The whole idea of constructs is that we look human, so we don’t make the clients uncomfortable with our appearance. (I could have told the company that the fact that SecUnits are terrifying killing machines does, in fact, make humans nervous regardless of what we look like, but nobody listens to me.) But the rest of my skin was hairless.

I told ART that I preferred it that way and extra hair would just draw unwanted attention. It replied that it meant the fine, sparse hair humans had on parts of their skin. ART had done some analysis and come up with a list of biological features that humans might notice subliminally. Hair was the only one we could change my underlying code to create, and ART proposed that it would make the joins between the organic and inorganic parts on my arms, legs, chest, and back look more like augments, the inorganic parts that humans had implanted for medical or other reasons. I pointed out that many humans or augmented humans had the hair on their bodies removed, for hygienic or cosmetic reasons and because who the hell wants it there anyway. ART countered that humans didn’t have to worry about being identified as SecUnits, so they could do whatever they wanted to their bodies.

I still wanted to argue, because I didn’t want to agree with anything ART said right now. But it seemed minor in comparison to removing two centimeters of synthetic bone and metal from my legs and arms, and changing the code for how my organic parts would grow around them.

ART had an alternate, more drastic plan that included giving me sex-related parts, and I told it that was absolutely not an option. I didn’t have any parts related to sex and I liked it that way. I had seen humans have sex on the entertainment feed and on my contracts, when I had been required to record everything the clients said and did. No, thank you, no. No.

But I did ask it to make an alteration to the dataport in the back of my neck. It was a vulnerable point, and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to take care of it.

Once we agreed on the process, I stood in front of the surgical suite. The MedSystem had just sterilized and prepped itself and there was a heavy scent of antibacterials in the air, reminding me of every time I had carried an injured client into a room like this. I was thinking about all the ways this could go wrong, and the terrible things ART could do to me if it wanted.

ART said, What is causing the delay? Is there a preliminary process left to complete?

I had no reason to trust it. Except the way it kept wanting to watch media about humans in ships, and got upset when the violence was too realistic.

I sighed, stripped off my clothes, and laid down on the surgical platform.

I came back online to find I was at 26 percent capacity, but the percentage was climbing slowly. Bands of pain circled my knee and elbow joints, so intense I couldn’t process it. My human skin itched. And I was leaking. I hate that.

I didn’t have the capacity to access or play any of my media. All I could do was lie there waiting for my levels to adjust. Attempts to move just made it worse. I wished I had gone with Plan Sixteen to render the ART inoperable, the one with the best statistical chance of success without me taking catastrophic damage in retaliation. Plan Two to blow it up was looking pretty attractive at the moment, too. This had been a stupid thing to agree to.

It was like being in a cubicle after being shot to pieces, but without a cubicle’s ability to shut down higher functions until the repairs were complete. I had known going in that the MedSystem wouldn’t be able to adjust my pain level, but I hadn’t thought it would be this bad. I couldn’t adjust my own temperature, either, but I wasn’t cold, as the MedSystem was controlling the temperature of the room and the platform to keep me at a comfortable level. Cubicles didn’t do that and I had to admit it was nice.

Gradually my levels started to even out and I got back enough function to dial down my pain sensor and turn off the itching. I needed some pain to tell me what not to move until all the regrowth of my organic tissue was complete.

ART was hanging around out in my feed but mercifully hadn’t tried to talk to me yet. At 75 percent capacity, I tried to sit up.

MedSystem started to throw warnings and ART said, There is no reason to move now. During the process I ran a search of my onboard public information newsfeed bases during the time period in question, regarding unusual fatalities relating to mining. Do you want my conclusions based on the results?

I eased back down, feeling my organic parts cling to the warm metal of the platform. I was now leaking from a different spot. I told ART I knew how to fucking read search results.

I would defer to your expertise in shooting and killing things. You should defer to mine in data analysis.

I told it fine, whatever. I didn’t think there would be anything useful. 

It sent its conclusions into the feed. Admittedly, it made sense that a large number of deaths under unusual circumstances would end up in some sort of public record available to multiple newsfeeds, the way the DeltFall incident had. The RaviHyral incident might have been classed as an accident, but a company bond was involved so there would have been a legal battle. Though if the data said it was a rogue SecUnit who had killed everyone, that didn’t give me any more information than I already had.

Records across several archived newsfeeds indicate the site of the incident was likely a small installation called Ganaka Pit. The information originates in a source from Kalidon, a political entity on the Corporation Rim, where the company funding Ganaka Pit was based. There were fifty-seven fatalities. The cause is listed as “equipment failure.”

SecUnits were categorized on inventory as equipment.

ART waited, and when I didn’t say anything, added, So your initial assumption was correct, the incident did occur. Investigation can now proceed.

I wanted to shut down, but it would interfere with the healing process.

ART asked, Do you wish to watch media?

I didn’t respond, but it started an episode of Sanctuary Moon anyway.

When I was finally able to climb off the platform, I fell on the deck, but by the end of that cycle I was almost back to normal. The first thing I did was wash off all the blood and other assorted fluids in the bathing facility attached to the MedSystem bay. Security ready rooms had facilities where I could clean off the blood and fluids after a fight or a repair, but I had never used a facility meant for humans. ART had good ones, with the recycled cleaning fluid that was so much like water it was hard to tell the difference without a chemical analysis. You could adjust the temperature to make it warmer, and it smelled good. I smelled like a clean human afterward, and that was just odd.

The fine hair that was coming up in patches in various places was strange but not as annoying as I had anticipated. It might be inconvenient the next time I had to put on a suit skin, but the humans with hair seemed to manage with a minimum of complaint, so I figured I would, too. The change in code had also made my eyebrows thicker and the hair on my head a few centimeters longer. I could feel it, and it was weird.

I went to ART’s rec space and used the treadmill and the other machines to test myself, making sure my weapons were still functioning correctly and my aim wasn’t off. (I didn’t test fire them, as ART let me know that it would set off the fire protection system if I did.)

I looked at myself in the mirror for a long time.

I told myself I still looked like a SecUnit without armor, hopelessly exposed, but the truth was I did look more human. And now I knew why I hadn’t wanted to do this.

It would make it harder for me to pretend not to be a person.

We exited the wormhole on schedule. As soon as we were in range of the transit ring, ART stretched its reception and picked up the destination info packet for me, which included a more detailed map of RaviHyral. Rotating the map to look at it from every angle didn’t jog anything in the fragments of memory I had of that time. But it was interesting that Ganaka Pit wasn’t marked anywhere.

I could feel ART in my feed, looking over my figurative shoulder again. I checked the timestamp, and saw the map had been updated multiple times since the time period of my incident. “They took it off the map.”

Is this usual? ART asked. It dealt only with star maps, and removing something from one of those was kind of a big deal.

“I don’t know if it’s usual or not, but it makes sense, if the company or the clients wanted to conceal what happened.” If the company wanted to continue to sell contracts for SecUnits to other mining installations, concealing the fact, or at least obscuring the fact, that fatalities had occurred was important. Maybe instead of a legal battle, the company had paid out on the bonds quickly under the condition that the client minimize details about the incident in the public record. This hadn’t been a situation like GrayCris and DeltFall, where there were multiple parties involved and the company was all over the newsfeeds, trying to generate sympathy for itself.

ART pulled more historical info, searching the pit and service installation names that were listed. RaviHyral had originally been held by a number of companies with mining rights to different areas of the moon’s interior. But over the past two system-years, a company called Umro had bought out some of the claims, though many of the original companies were still operating as contractors. None of the names sounded familiar.

I’d have to figure out where Ganaka Pit had been before I could go there. I would have been transported there as freight and there weren’t any memories of the trip, partially erased or not.

I started to search through the rest of the info packet, looking for schedules. I would have to get a shuttle from the transit ring to the RaviHyral port. That would be tricky. Well, the whole thing would be tricky. From the information on the shipping schedule, only people with employment vouchers or passes from one of the mining installations or support services were allowed to board the shuttles. There was no tourism, nobody coming and going without official authorization from one of the companies or contractors on the moon. Since I wasn’t a person and I didn’t have an employment voucher, I would have to hack my way into one of the supply shuttles …

ART was still pulling data from the station feed. I have a suggestion, it told me, and displayed a set of personal advertisements. I had seen these in the feeds at Port FreeCommerce and the last transit ring, but hadn’t paid attention. ART highlighted one that was a job listing for a temporary position as security for a technologist group on limited contract.

“What?” I asked ART. I didn’t understand why it was showing me this.

If this group hired you, you would have an employment voucher for travel to the installation.

“Hire me.” I’ve had more contracts than I can remember (I mean that literally. A lot of them were before the memory purge) but none of them were voluntary. The company pulled me out of storage, showed me to the client, then packed me into the cargo hold. “Have you lost your mind?”

My crew hires consultants for every voyage. ART was impatient that I wasn’t complimenting it yet on its great idea. The procedure is simple.

“For humans and augmented humans, yes.” I was stalling. I would have to interact with humans as an augmented human. I know that’s what altering my configuration was supposed to be for, but I had imagined it as taking place from a distance, or in the spaces of a crowded transit ring. Interacting meant talking, and eye contact. I could already feel my performance capacity dropping.

It will be simple, ART insisted. I’ll assist you.

Yes, the giant transport bot is going to help the construct SecUnit pretend to be human. This will go well.

Once ART was docked and the transit ring’s bot-piloted tugs were removing the cargo modules, it cycled the lock for me and I slipped through into the embarkation zone. It had given me access to its comm so it could ride my feed through the transit ring. It claimed it could help me and while I was skeptical of that, it could at least keep me company. As I walked away from the safety of ART’s lock, I dropped back down to 96 percent efficiency. I hit the station entertainment feeds for new downloads to try to calm down. 

I’d already sent a message to the social feed node about the advertisement, and gotten an answer with a location and timestamp. The last time I’d had an arranged meeting with humans they kidnapped Mensah and blew me up, so. This could hardly be worse.

I hacked my way through embarkation zone security and out into the ring’s mall. It was utilitarian compared to both the last transit ring and Port FreeCommerce. No garden pods, no holo sculptures, no big holo displays advertising arrays of shipwrights and cargo factors and other businesses, no shiny new interface vending machines. Also no big passenger transports coming through, so not nearly as big a crowd, of humans or bots. ART’s idea was beginning to seem less like a stupid risk and more like a necessity. Blending in here would be harder, if everyone was only here on their way to and from the installations on the moon. In my feed, ART said, I told you so.

The location for the meeting was a food service place in the main mall area. It was in a large transparent bubble in the second level of the mall, overlooking the walkways and counter service stalls below. There were multiple open levels inside, with tables and chairs, and it was 40 percent full of humans and augmented humans. As I walked through, I picked up the occasional buzz of a drone, but no pings. There were food smells in the air, and the acrid scents of intoxicants. I didn’t bother to try to analyze and identify them; I was too nervous and trying to focus on looking like an augmented human.

The humans I was to meet had sent an image so I could find them. There were three of them, all wearing variations on work clothes, no uniform logos. A quick search had shown entries for them in the transit ring’s social feed. They had listed themselves as unaffiliated guest workers, but you could list yourself as anything, there was no identity check. Two were female, and one was tercera, which was a gender signifier used in the group of non-corporate political entities known as the Divarti Cluster.

(To initiate the meeting, I’d had to make an entry on the social feed, too. The system was extremely vulnerable to hacking, so I had backdated my entry to look like I had come in on an earlier passenger transport, listed my job as “security consultant,” and my gender as indeterminate. Posing as its own captain, ART gave me a prior employment reference.)

I spotted them at a table near the bubble overlooking the mall. They were having a tense whispered conversation and body language said they were nervous. As I walked toward them, my quick scan showed no weapon signatures, just the small power sources of their personal feed interfaces. One had an implant, but it was just a low-level feed access tool.

I had practiced this part with ART on approach to the ring, recording myself so both of us could critique it. I told myself I could do this. I put on my best neutral expression, the one I used when the extra download activity had been detected and the deployment center’s supervisor was blaming the human techs for it. I walked up to the table and said, “Hello.”

All three of them flinched. “Uh, hello,” the tercera said, recovering first.

I picked up the feed from the security camera so I could watch myself and make sure my facial expressions were under control. And it was easier to talk to the humans while watching them through the cameras. I was well aware it was a completely false sensation of distance from the situation, but I needed it. I said, “We arranged to meet. I’m Eden, the security consultant.” Right, so, it was the name of one of the characters in Sanctuary Moon. You probably aren’t surprised by that.

The tercera cleared ter throat. Te had purple hair and red eyebrows, standing out against light brown skin. “I’m Rami, that’s Tapan, and Maro.” Te shifted nervously and tapped the empty chair.

ART, who was considerably faster than me at data retrieval, performed a quick search and informed me it was an invitation to sit down across several human cultural indices. It was giving me the etymology of the gesture as I sat down. You would think a SecUnit who had been shot to pieces multiple times, blown up, memory purged, and once partially dismantled by accident wouldn’t be on the verge of panic under these circumstances. You’d be wrong.

Rami added, “Uh, I’m not sure where to start.” Tapan nudged ter, apparently conveying moral support. Tapan had multicolored braids wrapped up around her head, and a blue jewel-toned interface clipped to her ear, and slightly darker skin than Rami. Maro had very dark skin, and silver-colored little puffs of hair, and was almost beautiful enough to be in the entertainment media. I’m terrible at estimating human ages because it’s not one of the few things I care about. Also most of my experience is with the humans on the entertainment feed, and they aren’t anything like the ones you see in reality. (One of the many reasons I’m not fond of reality.) But I thought all three might be young. Not children, but maybe not that far from adolescence.

They stared at me, and I realized I was going to have to help. I said, cautiously, “You want to hire a security consultant?” This was what they had posted on the social feed, and from the number of similar requests, it was common for groups and individuals to hire private security before going to RaviHyral. I guess hiring human security guards is what you do when you can’t afford real security.

Rami seemed relieved. “Yes, we need help.”

Maro threw a look around and said, “We shouldn’t talk here, maybe. Is there someplace else we could go?”

It had been stressful enough getting here, I didn’t want to have to go anywhere else right now. I did a quick scan for drones, then initiated a glitch in the connection between the restaurant and transit ring security. I caught the cameras and showed ART what I wanted it to do. It took over and edited me out of the system’s recording and cut the camera watching the table out of the system. I unglitched the connection to the ring’s main security, which wouldn’t notice the missing camera feed for the short time we would be here. I said, “It’s all right. We’re not being recorded.”

They stared at me. Rami said, “But there’s security—Did you do something?”

“I’m a security consultant,” I repeated. My panic level was starting to drop, primarily because they were so obviously nervous. Humans are nervous of me because I’m a terrifying murderbot, and I’m nervous of them because they’re humans. But I knew that humans could also be wary and nervous of each other in non-combat and non-adversarial situations, in reality and not just as part of a story. That was what seemed to be happening, but it let me pretend this was business as usual during one of the rare occasions when clients asked my advice about security.

Part of my job as a SecUnit was to give clients advice when they asked for it, as I was theoretically the one with all the information on security. Not that a lot of them had asked for it, or had listened to me. Not that I’m bitter about that, or anything.

Tapan looked impressed. “So you’re spliced, right?” She patted the back of her neck, indicating where my data port was. “You got augments? You have extra access to the feed?”

“Spliced” was an informal term for an augmented human; I’d heard it on the entertainment feed. I said, “Yes.” Then added, “Among other things.”

Rami’s red brows lifted in understanding. Maro looked impressed, and said, “I don’t know if we can afford— Our credit account is— If we can get our data back, then—” 

Rami took it up again. “Then we would have plenty to pay you.”

ART, who was apparently very interested in the job scenario, started to search the public feeds for a pay scale for private security consultants. I reminded myself that I was pretending not to be a SecUnit, so me questioning them wouldn’t seem out of the ordinary. I decided to start with the basic information. “Why do you want to hire me?”

Rami looked at the other two, got nods in response, and cleared ter throat. “We were working on RaviHyral, for Tlacey Excavations, one of the smaller Umro contractors. We do mineral research and technology development.” Te explained that they were a collective of technologists, seven of them plus dependents, who traveled from work contract to work contract. The others were waiting in a hotel suite, with Rami, Maro, and Tapan having been deputized to act for the group. It was a relief to hear that their mining experience was in tech and research; in the mining contracts I had had, the techs were usually in offices off the pit site or adjacent to it, and we didn’t see them unless they got intoxicated and tried to kill each other, which admittedly was rare.

“Tlacey’s terms were great,” Tapan added, “but maybe too great, if you know what I mean.”

ART did a quick search and returned the opinion that it was intended to be a figure of speech. I told it I knew that.

Rami continued, “We took the contract because it would give us time to work on our own stuff. We’d had this idea to develop a new detection system for strange synthetics. RaviHyral has a lot of identified deposits, so it’s a great place for research.” Strange synthetics were elements left behind by alien civilizations. Telling the difference between them and naturally occurring elements that were previously unidentified was a problem in mining. Like the remnants of alien occupation/civilization uncovered by GrayCris on my last contract, they were off limits for commercial development. That was all I’d ever needed to know, since every job I’d ever had involving alien material was just me standing around guarding the people who were working on it. (ART tried to explain it to me and I told it to save it for later, I needed to focus.)

Rami said, “We were making good progress, but then suddenly our group got terminated with no notice, and they took our data—”

Tapan waved her hands. “All our work! It wasn’t anything to do with our contract—”

Maro finished, “Tlacey stole it, basically, and they deleted the most current version off our devices. We had copies of the older iterations, but we’ve lost all our recent work.”

Rami added, “We filed a complaint with Umro, but it’s taking forever to process it, and we don’t know if it’s ever going to come to anything.”

I said, “This sounds like something you should go to a solicitor about.” It wasn’t unusual. The company data mined, too, but it wasn’t as clumsy or obvious as to try to delete the work from the original creators’ devices. If it did that, then the creators wouldn’t come back and enter into more security bond agreements, which would give the company access to whatever they were working on next.

“We thought about a solicitor,” Rami said. “But we aren’t in the union, so it would be expensive. But then yesterday Tlacey finally answered our petition, and said we could have the files back if we returned our signing bonus. We have to go down to RaviHyral to do that.” Te sat back in ter chair. “That’s why we wanted to hire you.”

This was starting to make sense. “You don’t trust Tlacey.”

“We just want somebody on our side,” Tapan clarified.

“No, we definitely don’t trust Tlacey,” Maro countered. “Not at all. We need security for when we get there, if things get … touchy. Tlacey herself is supposed to meet us, and she has an entourage of bodyguards, and there’s no general security except what Umro has in the public areas and the port, and that’s not much.”

I didn’t know exactly what she thought she meant by “touchy,” but all the scenarios I could imagine in that situation weren’t good ones.

The company offered SecUnits so the clients didn’t have to hire humans to guard each other. From what I had seen in the serials, me doing a half-assed version of my job was still better than a human trying to do it.

I was still watching us through the captured security camera even though I wasn’t allowing it to record. I could see my expression was dubious, but in this case I think the situation warranted it. I said, “The meeting with Tlacey could be held through a secured comm channel.” The company bonded those, too, for funds and data transfer.

Maro, whose expression was even more dubious than mine, said, “Yeah, but Tlacey wants to do it in person.”

Rami admitted, “We know it doesn’t sound like a good idea to go.”

It was a great idea to go if you wanted to be murdered. I had hoped for an easier job, courier duty, or something similar. But this was protecting humans who were determined to do something dangerous, which was exactly the kind of job I was designed for. The job that I had kept doing more or less, often as less as possible, even after I had hacked my governor module. I was used to having something useful to do, taking care of something, even if it was only a contractually obligated group of humans who if I was lucky treated me like a tool and not a toy.

After PreservationAux, it had occurred to me how different it would be to do my job as an actual member of the group I was protecting. And that was the main reason I was here.

I phrased it as a question, because pretending you were asking for more information was the best way to try to get the humans to realize they were doing something stupid. “So do you think there’s another reason Tlacey wants you to do this exchange in person, other than … killing you?”

Tapan grimaced, as if that was something she had been aware of but trying not to think about. Maro tapped the table and pointed at me, which was vaguely alarming until ART identified it as a gesture of emphatic agreement. Rami took a sharp breath and said, “We think … We weren’t finished, our process was incomplete, but we were so enthusiastic about it … We think they must have listened in using the security feeds and heard us talking, and thought we were much further along than we actually were. So I don’t know if they can complete it. Maybe they realized it’s not worth much without us to finish it.”

“Maybe Tlacey wants us to work for her again,” Tapan said hopefully.

Probably, before she murders you, I didn’t say.

Maro snorted. “I would rather live in a box in a station mall than work for her again.”

Once they had started to talk about it, it was hard for them to stop. The collective was completely divided on what to do, which was apparently painful for all of them since they were used to agreeing on everything. Tapan, who according to Maro was too naive for this existence, thought it was worth a try. Maro, who according to Tapan was a cynical impediment to both fun and progress, thought they were screwed and should just cut their losses. Rami was undecided, which was why te had been elected leader of the collective for the duration of this problem. Rami did not seem thrilled by the collective’s confidence, but was gamely trying to proceed.

Finally, Rami finished up with, “So that’s why we want to hire you. We thought it would be better to go in with someone who could protect us, keep her crew from messing with us, show her we have backup while we negotiate.” 

What they needed was a security company willing to bond them for the meeting and return trip, and send a SecUnit with them to guarantee their safety. But security companies like that are expensive, and wouldn’t be interested in a job this small.

They all stared at me worriedly. In the security camera view, from that angle, it was obvious how small they were. They looked so soft, with all the fluffy multicolored hair. And nervous, but not of me. I said, “I accept your job.”

Rami and Tapan looked relieved, and Maro, who clearly still didn’t want to do this, looked resigned. She said, “How much do we pay you?” She glanced uncertainly at the others. “Can we afford you, I mean.”

ART had a set of spreadsheets ready but I didn’t want to scare them off with a figure that was too high. “How much were they paying you before you were terminated?”

Rami said, “It’s two hundred CRs per cycle for each worker for the limited term of contract.”

It didn’t sound like this would take more than a cycle. “You can pay me that.”

“One cycle’s share of the contract?” Rami sat up straight. “Really?”

Ter reaction meant I’d asked for far too little, but it was too late to correct the mistake. I did need to give them a reason why I was willing to settle for a small amount, and I decided the partial truth was better. “I need to go to RaviHyral, and I need an employment contract to get there.”

“Why?” Tapan asked, and Rami nudged her by way of admonishment. “I mean, I know we don’t have a right to ask, but…”

Don’t have a right to ask. That wasn’t something that had ever applied to me, before PreservationAux. I told the truth again. “I need to do some research there for another client.”

Like ART, they understood the idea of research, especially proprietary research, and they didn’t ask any further questions. Rami told me they were scheduled to leave for RaviHyral during the next cycle, and said te would put in the request for the private employment voucher. I arranged to meet them in the mall near the access for the shuttle embarkation zone and then left. I released the security camera as soon as I was out of range.

I got back to ART and huddled in my favorite chair and we watched episodes for the next three hours while I calmed down. ART monitored the transit ring’s alert feed in case someone had realized what I was, but there was nothing.

I told you so, ART said. Again.

I ignored it. I hadn’t been detected, so now it was time to think about the rest of the plan. Which now involved keeping my new clients alive.

I met them at the embarkation zone. I had the knapsack, which was part of my human disguise, but the only important thing I was carrying was the comm interface from ART. It would allow us to communicate once I was down on RaviHyral and let me continue to have access to ART’s knowledge bases and unsolicited opinions. I was used to having a HubSystem and a SecSystem for backup and ART would be taking their place. (Without the part where those two systems were partly designed to rat me out to the company and trigger punishment through the governor module. ART’s freedom to weigh in on everything I did was punishment enough.) I had inserted the comm interface in a built-in compartment under my ribs.

All three of my clients were waiting, each with a small bag or pack, since hopefully they would only be staying a couple cycles. I hung back until they finished saying goodbye to the other members of their collective. They all looked worried. The collective was listed in the social feed as a group marriage, and had five children of various sizes. Once the others had left and Rami, Maro, and Tapan were alone, I came forward.

“Tlacey bought us passage on a public shuttle,” Rami told me. “That could be a good sign, right?”

“Sure,” I said. It was a terrible sign.

The employment voucher got me through into the embarkation zone and there was no weapons scan. RaviHyral allowed private weapons and had a low security presence in public areas, which was one reason small groups of humans needed to hire private security consultants to go there. As we approached the shuttle’s lock I sent to ART: Can you scan the shuttle for energy anomalies without transit ring security detecting the activity?

No, but I’ll tell it I’m running scanning diagnostics and testing systems.

As we reached the lock, ART reported No anomalies, 90 percent match to factory specs.

That was normal, and meant if there was an explosive device, it was inert at the moment, buried somewhere inside the hull. Five other guest workers waited to board, and my scan read no energy signatures. They had stuffed packs and bags, indicating packing for a long-term stay. I let them board first, then slid in front of Maro and went through the lock, scanning as I went.

The shuttle was bot-driven and the only crew was one augmented human who seemed only there to check employment vouchers and shuttle passes. She looked at me and said, “There’s only supposed to be three of you.”

I didn’t answer, being in the middle of wrestling the security system for control. It was an entirely separate system from the bot pilot, which was non-standard for the shuttles I was used to.

Tapan’s chin jutted out. “This is our security consultant.”

I had control of ShuttleSecSys, and deleted its attempt to alert the bot pilot and the crew member to the fact that it was compromised.

The crew member frowned, checked the voucher again, but didn’t argue. We went on into the compartment where the other passengers were getting seated. They were stowing their possessions or talking quietly. I hadn’t eliminated them as potential threats, but their behavior was lowering the probability at a steady rate.

I took a seat next to Rami as my clients got settled and pinged ART again. ART said, I’m scanning for targeting anomalies and situation is currently clear.

It meant it couldn’t see anything on the moon aiming at us. If that was the plan, it wouldn’t happen until we were underway. If somebody fired at the transit ring from the moon’s surface, I was pretty sure that would be a huge deal and there would be legal ramifications, if not immediate violent retaliation by ring security. I told ART, If they fire at us en route, it’s not like we can do anything about it.

ART didn’t answer, but I knew it well enough by now to know that meant something. I said, You don’t have a weapons system. There hadn’t been one on the schematics. At least the schematics that ART made available in its unsecured feed. Do you?

ART admitted, I have a debris deflection system.

There’s only one way to deflect debris. I had never been on an armed ship but I knew they were subject to a whole different level of licensing and bond agreements. (If one of them accidentally shoots something it’s not supposed to, somebody has to pay for the damage.) I said, You have a weapons system.

ART repeated, For debris deflection.

I was starting to wonder just what kind of university owned ART.

Rami was watching me worriedly. “Is everything okay?”

I nodded and tried to look neutral.

Tapan leaned past ter to ask, “Are you in the feed? I can’t find you.”

I told her, “I’m on a private channel with a friend in the ring who’s monitoring the shuttle’s departure. Just making sure everything’s okay.” 

They nodded and sat back.

The shudder went through the deck that meant the shuttle had uncoupled from the ring and started to move. I cozied up to the bot pilot. It was a limited function model, not nearly as complex as even a standard transport driver bot. I had the ShuttleSecSys tell it I was authorized by ring security, and it pinged me cheerfully. The crew member was sitting in the cockpit with it, using her feed to catch up on admin tasks and read her social feed download, but there was no human pilot aboard.

I leaned back in my seat and relaxed a little. Media was tempting, and from the echoes I could pick up in the feed, that’s what most of the humans were doing. But I wanted to keep monitoring the bot pilot. This may seem overcautious, but that’s how I was built.

Then twenty-four minutes forty-seven seconds into the flight, as we were on approach, the bot pilot screamed and died as killware flooded its system. It was gone before ShuttleSecSys or I could react; I flung up a wall around us both and the killware bounced off. I saw it register task complete and then destroy itself.

Oh, shit. ART! I used ShuttleSecSys to grab the controls. We needed the course correction in seven point two seconds. The crew member, jolted out of her feed by the alarms, stared at the board in horror, then hit the emergency beacon. She couldn’t fly a shuttle. I can fly hoppers and other upper atmosphere aircraft, but I had never been given the education module for shuttles or other space-going vehicles. I nudged ShuttleSecSys, hoping for help, and it set off all the cabin alarms. Yeah, that didn’t help.

Let me in, ART said, as cool and calm as if we were discussing what show to watch next.

I had never given ART full access to my brain. I had let it alter my body, but not this. We had three seconds and counting. My clients, the other humans on the shuttle. I let it in.

It was like the sensation humans describe in books as having their heads shoved underwater. Then it was gone and ART was in the shuttle, using my connection with ShuttleSecSys to leap into the void left by the erased bot. ART flowed into the controls, made the course correction and adjusted our speed, then picked up the landing beacon and guided the shuttle into approach on the main RaviHyral port. The crew member had just managed to hail Port Authority, and was still hyperventilating. Port Authority had the ability to upload emergency landing routines, but the timing had been too tight. Nothing they could have done would have saved us.

Rami touched my arm and said, “Are you okay?”

I’d squeezed my eyes shut. “Yes,” I told ter. Remembering that humans usually want more than that from other humans, I pointed up to indicate the alarms and added, “I’ve got sensitive hearing.”

Rami nodded sympathetically. The others were worried, but there hadn’t been an announcement and they could see our route in the feed from the port, which was still giving us an on-time arrival.

The crew member tried to explain to Port Authority that there had been a catastrophic failure, the pilot bot was gone, and she didn’t know why the shuttle was following its normal route and not slamming into the surface of the moon. ShuttleSecSys tried to analyze ART and almost got itself deleted. I took over ShuttleSecSys, turned off the alarms, and deleted the entire trip out of its memory.

There were murmurs of relief from the passengers as the alarms stopped. I made a suggestion to ART, and it sent an error code to Port Authority, which assigned us a new priority and switched our landing site from the public dock to the emergency services dock. Since the killware had clearly been intended to destroy us en route, there might not be anybody waiting for us at our scheduled landing slot, but better safe than sorry.

The feed was giving us a visual of the port, which was inside a cavern, carved out of the side of a mountain, surrounded by the towers of a debris deflection grid. (An actual debris deflection system, as opposed to ART’s concealed rail gun or whatever it had.) The lights of multiple levels of the port installation gleamed in the darkness, and smaller shuttles whizzed out of our way as we curved down toward the Port Authority’s beacon.

Maro was watching me with narrowed eyes. When the notice of changed landing site came through the feed, she leaned forward and said, “You know what happened?”

Fortunately I remembered that nobody expected me to be compelled to answer all questions immediately. One of the benefits to being an augmented human security consultant rather than a construct SecUnit. I said, “We’ll talk about it when we’re off the shuttle,” and they all seemed satisfied.

ART landed us in the Port Authority’s slot. We left the shuttle crew member trying to explain to the emergency techs what had happened as they connected their diagnostic equipment. ART was already gone, deleting any evidence of its presence, and the ShuttleSecSys was confused, but at least still intact, unlike the poor pilot bot.

Emergency services personnel and bots milled around the small embarkation zone. I managed to herd my clients through and out onto the clear enclosed walkway to the main port before anyone thought to try to stop them. I had already downloaded a map from the public feed and was testing the robustness of the security system. The walkway had a view of the cavern, with the multiple levels of landing slots and a few shuttles coming and going. At the far end were the big haulers for the mining installations.

Security seemed to be intermittent and based on the level of paranoia of whatever contractor operated in the territory you were passing through. That could be both an advantage and an interesting challenge. The transit ring’s public info feed had warned that a lot of humans apparently carried weapons here, and there were no screening scans.

We came out into a central hub, which had a high clear dome allowing a view of the cavern arching overhead, with lights trained on it to show off the colorful mineral veins. I scanned to make sure nothing was recording us and stopped Rami. Te and the others looked up at me and I said, “The person you’re going to meet with just tried to kill you.”

Rami blinked, Maro went wide-eyed, and Tapan drew breath to argue. I said, “The shuttle was infected with killware. It destroyed the bot pilot. I was in contact with a friend who was able to use my augmented feed to download a new pilot module. That’s the only reason we didn’t crash.”

A module could have put the shuttle into a safe orbit, but wouldn’t have been sophisticated enough to manage the tricky, flawless landing. I was hoping they wouldn’t realize that.

Tapan closed her mouth. Shocked, Maro said, “But the other passengers. The crew person. They would have killed everybody?”

I said, “If you were the only casualties, the motive would have been obvious.”

I could see it was starting to sink in. I said, “You should return to the transit ring immediately.” I checked the public feed for the schedule. There was a public shuttle leaving in eleven minutes. Tlacey wouldn’t have time to trace my clients and infect it if they moved fast.

Tapan and Maro looked at Rami. Te hesitated, then set ter jaw and said, “I’ll stay. You two go.”

“No,” Maro said instantly, “we’re not leaving you.” Tapan added, “We’re in this together.”

Rami’s face almost crumpled, their support weakening ter when the prospect of death hadn’t. Te controlled terself and nodded tightly. Te looked at me and said, “We’ll stay.”

I didn’t react visibly, because I’m used to clients making bad decisions, and I was getting a lot of practice at controlling my expression. “You can’t keep this meeting. They lost track of you when the shuttle didn’t dock at its scheduled slot. You have to keep that advantage.” 

“But we have to have the meeting,” Tapan protested. “We can’t get our work back otherwise.”

Yes, I often want to shake my clients. No, I never do. “Tlacey has no intention of giving you back your work. She lured you here to kill you.”

“Yes, but—” Tapan began.

“Tapan, just hush and listen,” Maro interrupted, clearly exasperated.

Rami looked stubborn, but asked, “Then what should we do?”

Technically, this didn’t have to be my problem. I was here now and didn’t need them anymore. I could lose them in the crowd and leave them to deal with their murderous ex-employer all on their own.

But they were clients. Even after I’d hacked my governor module, I’d found it impossible to abandon clients I hadn’t chosen. I’d made an agreement with these clients as a free agent. I couldn’t leave. I kept my sigh internal. “You can’t meet Tlacey at her compound. You’ll pick the spot.”

It wasn’t ideal, but it would have to do.

My clients picked a food service place in the center of the port. It was on a raised platform, the tables and chairs arranged in groups, with displays floating above advertising various port and contractor services and information about the different mining installations. The displays also functioned as camera and recording chaff, so the place was a popular spot for business meetings.

Rami, Tapan, and Maro had picked a table and were nervously fiddling with the drinks they had ordered from one of the bots drifting around. They had put in a comm call to Tlacey, and were waiting for a representative to arrive.

The security system in this public area was more sophisticated than ShuttleSecSys but not by much. I had gotten in far enough to monitor emergency traffic and get views from the cameras focused on our immediate area. I felt pretty confident. I was standing three meters from the table, pretending to look at the ad displays and examining the map of the installations I had found in the public feed. There were plenty of abandoned dig sites marked, as well as tube accesses that went off into apparently nowhere. Ganaka Pit had to be one of them.

ART said in my ear, There must be an accessible information archive. Ganaka Pit’s existence would not be deleted from it. The absence would be too obvious to researchers.

That depended on the research. Someone working on strange synthetics would obviously care about where they were found, but not necessarily about what company had dug them up, or why that company wasn’t around anymore. But whoever had removed Ganaka Pit from the map would have been trying to obscure its existence from casual journalists, not erase it entirely from the memory of the population.

ART’s data had been correct; there were other SecUnits on this moon. The map showed logos from five bond companies that offered SecUnits, including my company, at seven of the most remote installations where exploration for mineral veins was still ongoing. They would be there to defend the claim from theft and to keep the miners and other employees from injuring each other as part of the bond guarantee. No SecUnits would travel through the port except as inert cargo in transport boxes or repair cubicles, so that was one less thing to worry about. My altered configuration might fool humans and augmented humans, but not other SecUnits.

If they saw me, they would alert their SecSystems. They wouldn’t have a choice. And they wouldn’t want one. If anybody knows how dangerous rogue SecUnits are, it’s other SecUnits.

That was when I felt the ping.

I told myself I’d mistaken it for something else. Then it happened again. That’s a big uh-oh.

Something was looking for SecUnits. Not just bots, specifically SecUnits, and it was close. It hadn’t pinged me directly, though if I’d had a working governor module, I would have been compelled to answer.

Three humans approached the table my clients were sitting at. Rami whispered into ter feed, “That’s Tlacey. I didn’t expect her to come herself.” Two of the humans were large and male and one of them lengthened his stride to reach the table. Maro had seen him and from the look on her face I knew this was not going to be a greeting. Scan showed he was armed.

I moved between him and the table. I put a hand up at his chest height and said, “Stop.”

On most contracts this was as far as I was allowed to go with a human until they made physical contact. But you’d be surprised how often this works, if you do it right. Though that was when I was wearing my armor with the helmet opaqued. Standing here in normal human clothes with my human face showing made it a whole different thing. But it wasn’t like he could hurt me by hitting me and he hadn’t drawn his weapon yet.

I could have torn through him like tissue paper.

He didn’t know that, but he must have been able to tell from my face that I wasn’t afraid of him. I checked the security camera to see what I looked like, and decided I looked bored. That wasn’t unusual, because I almost always looked bored while I was doing my job, it was just impossible to tell when I was in my armor.

He visibly regrouped and said, “Who the fuck are you?”

My clients had shoved their chairs back and were on their feet. Rami said, “This is our security consultant.”

He stepped back, and glanced uncertainly at the other two, the second male human bodyguard and Tlacey, who was an augmented human female.

I dropped my arm but didn’t move. I had clear shots at all three of them, but that was a worst-case scenario. For me, at least. Humans can miss a lot of little clues, but me being able to fire energy weapons from my arms would be something of a red flag. I diverted just enough attention to scan the security camera feeds for whatever it was that had pinged me.

I caught an image on a camera across the public area, near one of the entrance tunnels. The figure standing near the edge of the seating area didn’t match what I was expecting to see and I had to review it again before I understood. It wasn’t wearing armor and its physical configuration didn’t match SecUnit standard. It had a lot of hair, silver with blue and purple on the ends, pulled back and braided like Tapan’s but in a much more complicated pattern. Its facial features were different from mine, but all Units’ features are different, assigned randomly based on the human cloned material that’s used to make our organic parts. Its arms were bare, and there was no metal showing and no gun ports. This was not a SecUnit.

I was looking at a .

That is not the official designation, ART said.

The official designation is ComfortUnit but everybody knows what that means.

s aren’t allowed to walk around in human areas without orders, any more than murderbots. Someone must have sent it here.

ART poked me hard enough to make me twitch. I snapped out of it and ran my recording back a little to catch up on what was happening.

Tlacey had stepped forward. “And just why do you need a security consultant?”

Rami took a breath. I hit ter feed, secured a private connection between ter, Tapan, and Maro, and told ter, Don’t answer that. Don’t mention the attempt on the shuttle. Just stick to business. It was an impulse. Tlacey had come here expecting an angry confrontation; that was why she had brought armed bodyguards. We had an advantage now; we weren’t dead, and they were off balance and we wanted to keep them that way.

Rami let the breath out, tapped my feed in acknowledgment, then said, “We’re here to talk about our files.” 

Maro, who had realized what I was trying to do, told Rami, Keep going, don’t even let them sit down.

Sounding more confident, Rami continued, “Deleting our personal work was not part of our employment contract. But we’ll agree to your proposal that we return our signing bonus in exchange for our files.”

On the security cameras, I watched the  turn and leave the public area via the tunnel directly behind it.

Tlacey said, “The entire bonus?” She clearly hadn’t expected them to agree.

Maro leaned forward. “We opened an account with Umro to hold the funds. We can transfer it to you as soon as you give us the files.”

Tlacey’s jaw moved as she spoke in her private feed. The two bodyguards eased back. Tlacey stepped over and took a chair at my clients’ table. After a moment, Rami sat down, and Tapan and Maro followed suit.

I kept part of my attention on the negotiation, and went back to the public feed. I started pulling historical data, looking for any irregular activity around the time of my contract here.

While my clients were talking, and while I sorted through the data with ART peering over my shoulder again, I was watching the security cameras. I noted two more potential threats enter the area. Both were augmented humans. I had noted three potential threats already sitting at adjacent tables. (All three exhibited a curious lack of attention toward the confrontation occurring near the center of the seating area. The other humans and augmented humans in the immediate area had watched it with open or surreptitious curiosity.)

ART poked me. I see it, I told it. The search had turned up a series of notices posted around the right timeframe. They were warnings that changes in shipments of raw materials and supplies to outlying installations would cause diversions in the passenger tube routes. (The tube was a small-scale transit system that took passengers around the port and service centers and had private lines going out to the closer mining installations.) Later notices mentioned a new route that had been constructed to compensate for the diversion.

That was it. Reading between the lines, you could see that the service contractors had had to build a new tube route to bypass the tunnels that had led to a mining installation that had abruptly closed. That had to be the site of Ganaka Pit.

Other pit closures had been accompanied by local interest articles and excessive social feed interest in bankruptcy filings and the effect on the associated service companies. There was nothing like that about this closure. Someone had paid to have those postings deleted from the public feed.

The conversation was concluding. Tlacey stood up, nodded to my clients, and walked away from the table. Rami’s expression was a grimace of doubt. Maro looked grim and Tapan somewhere between confused and angry.

I closed the search and stepped over to the table. Watching Tlacey and her bodyguards leave, Rami said, “It was a bad idea to come here.”

Tapan protested, “She said tomorrow…”

Maro shook her head. “It’s more lies. She isn’t going to give us the files. She could have done it here, if she was going to do it. She could have done it over the comm while we were on the transit ring.” She looked up at me. “I wasn’t sure I believed you about the shuttle, but now…”

I was keeping track of my potential threat list on the security cameras. “We need to go,” I told them. “We’ll talk about this somewhere else.”

As we left, one potential threat got up to follow us. I tapped ART to keep an eye on the others, just in case they weren’t innocent bystanders so deep in their feeds they really hadn’t noticed anything.

I had marked a few possible routes on the station map, and my favorite one was through a pedestrian tunnel that curved out away from the main living areas. There were various accesses along it leading to different tube stations, but it was not a popular route. I tapped Rami’s feed and told ter to take it toward the interchange where the largest hotel was. Listening in, Maro whispered, “We can’t afford that one.”

You won’t be staying there, I told them on the feed. The brochure on the public feed promised a high security lobby area and a fast tube access to the public shuttle slots.

We reached the tunnel and started down it. It was close to ten meters wide and four meters high, well-lit enough for walking down the center, but the sides were shadowy with darkened branching tunnels. There were security cameras, but the system monitoring them was not sophisticated. The company would have shit itself over the possible danger to bonded clients and the missed opportunity to data mine conversations.

There were other humans in the tunnel. Some miners in coveralls and jackets with logos from the various installations, but most were in civilian work clothes, either techs or workers for the support companies. They moved quickly and stayed in groups.

After eight minutes of walking, most of the other humans in the tunnel had turned off to one of the tube access points. I sent through the feed, Just keep walking, don’t stop. I’ll meet you in the lobby. I dropped back into one of the darker branching tunnels. My clients kept moving and didn’t look back at me, though I could tell Tapan wanted to.

On the cameras I watched Potential Threat/New Target make his way up the tunnel, walking quickly. He was joined by two new humans, now designated Target Two and Target Three. They passed me and I came out of the tube access and followed at a distance. I scanned them for energy weapons and found no readings. All three Targets wore jackets and pants with deep side pockets. I marked seven locations where knives or extendable batons could be carried.

When they caught sight of my clients, the Targets slowed down but continued to reduce the distance between them. I knew they were probably reporting to someone on their feed, asking for instructions. Whoever it was didn’t have control of the security cameras, at least not yet.

I followed, watching the targets through my eyes, through the security cameras, watching myself to make sure I wasn’t drawing attention, that no one was following me. ART kept quiet, though I could tell it was interested in watching me work.

Then the last group of miners between me and the Targets turned into a tube access. We were in a bend of the tunnel and there was no one between my clients and the next bend some fifty meters ahead, and the security cameras showed me the tunnel was empty behind me. I needed to get this over with. I turned into the tube access behind the miners.

I stopped at the top of the tube access while the miners boarded the capsule. The door hissed as it closed and the capsule moved away. On security camera view, Target Two’s jaw moved, indicating that he was speaking sub-vocally in his feed. Then the camera’s feed cut off.

I turned the corner back into the tunnel and started to run.

It was a calculated risk, as I couldn’t move at top speed without revealing I wasn’t human. But I managed to arrive just as Target One reached Rami and grabbed the sleeve of ter jacket. I broke his arm and slammed an elbow into his chin, then swung him into Target Two, who had turned toward me with the knife he had been approaching Maro with. Target Two accidentally (I’m guessing here; maybe they just didn’t care for each other) stabbed Target One. Target Two staggered sideways and I dropped Target One, and broke Target Two’s kneecap. Target Three had had time to lift his baton and now hit me across the left side of my head and shoulder which, granted, annoyed me a little, but I’ve had hauler bots hit me harder than that by accident. I blocked the second blow with my left arm, snapped his collarbone with one punch, and smashed his hip with another. 

He was lucky I wasn’t a lot annoyed.

All three Targets were on the floor, and Two was the only one who was still conscious, though he was curled up and whimpering. I turned to my clients.

Rami had a hand over ter mouth, Maro was frozen in place, staring, and Tapan had thrown her hands up in the air. I said in the feed, Go to the hotel, wait for me in the lobby. Don’t run, walk.

Maro came out of shock first. She nodded hard, caught Rami’s arm, and poked Tapan’s shoulder. Rami turned to go, but Tapan said, “Security?”

I knew what she was asking. “They told somebody to cut the cameras. That’s why you need to leave now.” The public feed up on the transit ring had said there was no overall security, but the security companies for the different service installations and contractors were supposed to take responsibility for the public areas nearest their territory. This spot had obviously been carefully calculated to be out of range of any immediate assistance by whoever had helped the Targets by cutting the camera feed. I wasn’t expecting an immediate response, but we did need to move relatively quickly.

Rami whispered, “Come on,” and they started away, walking fast but not running.

I turned to the Target that was still conscious and pressed down on the artery in his neck until he passed out.

I reached the interchange where various access tunnels and tube stations met, with a scatter of pop-up stands selling packaged food, feed interfaces, toiletries, and other things humans liked. It wasn’t crowded but there was a steady flow of foot traffic. The hotel entrance was on the far side.

The lobby was built on various platforms overlooking a holo sculpture of an open chasm filled with a giant crystalline structure growing out of the walls. From the notations in the feed, it was supposed to be educational, but I had serious doubts about whether the mines on RaviHyral looked like that. Especially after the mining bots got to them.

My clients were on the same platform as the check-in area, near the railing around the sculpture’s artificial chasm, sitting on a round backless couch thing that looked more like a decorative object than furniture.

I sat on my heels in front of them.

Rami said, “They were going to kill us.”

“Again,” I said.

Rami bit ter lip. “I believed you about the shuttle. I believed you…”

“But now you’ve seen it,” I said. I knew what te meant. There was a huge difference between knowing something happened and seeing the reality of it. Even for SecUnits.

Maro rubbed her eyes. “Yeah, we were idiots. Tlacey was never going to let us give her the bonus for our files.”

“No, she wasn’t,” I agreed.

Rami nudged her. “You were right.”

Maro looked more depressed. “I didn’t want to be.”

Tapan said miserably, “We’re wrecked.”

Rami put an arm around her. “We’re alive.” Te looked at me. “What do we do now?”

I said, “Let me get you out of here.”

I started away, walking at a normal pace. I was deep enough into the camera system to delete the temporary storage on the cameras ahead of and behind the deactivated camera. That would help obscure the issue for anybody trying to figure out what had happened. But Tlacey had seen me, and she would know. I was just hoping the kids listened to me this time.

I took them to the public shuttle slots first, then past that section to the private docks. Checking the schedules, ART had already scanned a likely shuttle. It was privately owned but the frequency of its trips to and from the transit ring suggested an entrepreneur who was offering private rides for hard currency.

This proved to be accurate, and it would allow Rami, Maro, and Tapan to leave without their employment vouchers being scanned. It would probably have been safe at this point to put them on a public shuttle, as long as there was no advance notice of which one they were taking. Killware couldn’t travel over the feed to infect a shuttle; there were too many protections in place. Whoever had planned to kill us on arrival had had to deliver the killware directly, through a data port actually inside the shuttle’s cockpit.

But I’m programmed to be paranoid. This private shuttle had the benefit not only of anonymity, but of an augmented human pilot who would be in place in case something interfered with the bot pilot. Plus ART, who was already cozying up to said bot pilot and would be keeping an eye on the shuttle during the brief trip. (ART’s idea of “cozying” being somewhat overbearing, I had already had to intervene once to assure the bot pilot that the big mean transport had promised not to hurt it.)

“You’re not going with us?” Rami asked, standing in the small embarkation area. The private docks were dingy and small compared to the Port Authority’s docks, with stains on the metal partitions and some of the lights up in the rocky ceiling broken or dim. Humans and a few bots were moving along the walkway above us, and I kept an eye on both approaches through the security cameras. The shuttle was already loaded into its slot and its hatch was open, with a small augmented human standing on the ramp to take the money. Six other passengers had already boarded and it was taking a large portion of my self-control not to just scoop up my clients and carry them onboard.

I said, “I still need to do some research here. I’ll go back to the transit ring when I’m finished.”

“How do we pay you?” Maro asked. “I mean, can we still afford you after … everything?” After they tried to kill us, she added in our joint feed connection.

“I’ll check my social feed profile on the ring,” I said, and felt pretty good that I had even remembered it existed. “Send a note to me there, and I’ll find you when I get back.”

“It’s just, I know we’re—” Tapan glanced around. Her expression was tense and unhappy, her body language bordering on desperate. “We can’t stay here, but I can’t give up, either. Our work—”

I said, “Sometimes people do things to you that you can’t do anything about. You just have to survive it and go on.”

They all stopped talking and stared at me. It made me nervous and I immediately switched my view to the nearest security camera so I could watch us from the side. I had said it with more emphasis than I intended, but it was just the way things were. I wasn’t sure why it had such an impact on them. Maybe I sounded like I knew what I was talking about. Maybe it was the two murder attempts.

Then Maro nodded, her mouth set in a grim line. She and Rami looked at each other and Rami nodded sadly. Maro said, “We need to get back to the others, figure out what to do next. Look for the next assignment.”

Rami added, “We’ll start over. We did it once, we can do it again.”

Tapan looked like she wanted to protest, but was too depressed to argue.

They wanted to say goodbye a lot and thank me, and I herded them up to the ramp while they were doing it, and watched Rami pay for their passage with a currency card that the crew person pressed to an interface. Then they were aboard.

The hatch closed and the shuttle’s feed signaled post-boarding mode, waiting for its clearance to leave. I went back down the access, heading for the walkway. I needed to get the tube over to the area where the tunnel diversion had occurred and start searching for Ganaka Pit. It was a relief to have my clients headed back to safety. But it felt odd to be on my own again, working for no one except myself. 

I went to the tube access and boarded the next capsule to stop. Each capsule had seating for twenty people, plus an overhead rack to hold on to. The gravity was adjusted inside the cab to compensate for the motion. I took a seat with the seven humans already aboard. ART said, The shuttle has launched. I’ll monitor your feed, but much of my attention will be on it.

I sent an acknowledgment. I was trying to isolate why I felt so uneasy. Trapped in a small enclosed space with humans, check. Missing my drones, check. My Giant Asshole Research Transport too busy to complain at, check. Needed to actually focus on what I was doing so couldn’t watch media, check. But that wasn’t what it was. I hadn’t done a good job for my clients. I had had the opportunity, and had failed. As a SecUnit, I had the responsibility for my clients’ safety but no authority to do anything other than make suggestions, and try to use the company regulations inbuilt in a SecSystem to override the humans’ suicidal stupidity and homicidal impulses. This time I had responsibility and authority, and had still failed.

I told myself they were alive, I just hadn’t gotten their property back, which had actually not been part of the job they hired me for. It didn’t help.

I got off the tube on the far end of its circuit. This was a warren of tunnels that according to the map led off to various private tube accesses for the distant mining pits. Only a few humans got off the tube here, all heading immediately down the tunnel for the nearest tube interchange. I went the other direction.

I spent the next hour hacking cameras and security barriers, slipping in and out of half-completed tunnels, many with warning markers for air quality. Finally I located one that showed evidence of past use as a mining access. It was big enough for the largest hauler bots, and the cameras and lights were down. As I went along it, climbing over rock and metal debris, I felt the public feed drop out.

I stopped and checked ART’s comm, but it was only picking up static. I didn’t think it was any deliberate attempt to block my connection to the rest of the installation; I’d experienced that type of outage before and this felt different. I think this tunnel was so deep below the surface that the comm and the feed needed powered relays to get out, and those weren’t functioning anymore. Something ahead still had power, because my feed was picking up intermittent signals, all automated warnings. I kept going.

I had to open another security barrier, but past it found a cargo tube access and managed to push the sliding door open. A small passenger tube was still there. It hadn’t been used in a long time, long enough for the water and scattered trash on the carpet to combine and grow something squishy. I made my way up to the front compartment where the manual emergency controls were. There was still power in the batteries, though not much. It had been left here, forgotten, slowly dying in the darkness as the hours ticked away.

Not that I was feeling morbid, or anything.

I checked to make sure there was no active security attached to it, then got it started. It groaned into life, lifted off the ground, and started down the tunnel into darkness, following its last programmed route. I sat down on the bench to wait.

Finally the tube’s scan picked up a blockage ahead and threw an alarm code. I had five episodes of different drama series, two comedies, a book about the history of the exploration of alien remnants in the Corporation Rim, and a multi-part art competition from Belal Tertiary Eleven queued and paused, but I was actually watching episode 206 of Sanctuary Moon, which I’d already seen twenty-seven times. Yes, I was a little nervous. When the tube started to slow, I sat up.

The lights shone on a line of metal barricades. Glowing markers had been sprayed on the material, sending out bursts of warning into my feed. Radiation hazard, falling rock hazard, toxic biological hazard. I got the emergency lock to unseal for me and jumped down to the gritty ground. I was scanning for energy signatures and I adjusted my eyesight to be able to see past the bright marker paint. There was a gap three meters along, a darker patch against the metal. It was small but I didn’t have to pop any joints to wriggle through.

I walked down the tunnel to the platform that had been part of the passenger tube access. Farther down there was a set of ten-meter-high doors, big enough for vehicles and the largest hauler bots to maneuver through and for the loads of raw mineral to come out. The passenger access had a cargo unloading rack still extended, and I used it to swing up to the high platform. Everything was covered with a layer of damp dust, which showed no recent tracks. The sealed crates of a supply delivery, with the logos of various contractors stamped on the boxes, still stood stacked on the platform. A broken breather mask lay beside it. My human parts were experiencing a cold prickling that wasn’t comfortable. This place was creepy. I reminded myself that the terrible thing that had most likely happened here was me.

Somehow that didn’t help.

There wasn’t enough power to move the doors, but the manual release for the passenger access lock still worked. There was no powered light in the corridor either, but the walls were streaked with light-emitting markers, meant to guide everyone out in the event of a catastrophic failure. Some had already failed with age, others were fading. The lack of any feed activity except from the warning paint was vaguely disturbing; I kept thinking of the DeltFall habitat and I was glad I had had ART make the adjustment to my data port.

I followed the corridor into the installation’s central hub. It was a large domed area, dark except for the fading markers on the ground. There were no human remains, of course, but debris was scattered around, tools, broken slivers of plastic, a chunk of hauler bot arm. Openings to corridors, like dark caves, branched off in all directions. I had no sense of having been here before, no sense of familiarity. I identified the passages that led toward the mine pit, then the corridors that went toward the quarters and offices. Branching off from that was the equipment storage.

The emergency power failure releases for the sealed doors had unlocked everything, but whoever had cleaned up afterward had left them shut, and I had to shove each one open. Past the maintenance stations for the hauler bots, I found the security ready room. I stepped in and froze. In the dimness, among the empty weapon storage boxes and the missing floor panels where the recycler had stood, there were familiar shapes. The cubicles were still here.

There were ten of them lined up against the far wall, big smooth white boxes, the dim marker light gleaming off the scuffed surfaces. I didn’t know why my performance reliability was dropping, why it was so hard to move. Then I realized it was because I thought the others were still in there.

It was a completely irrational thought that would have confirmed ART’s bad opinion of the mental abilities of constructs. They wouldn’t leave SecUnits here. We were too expensive, too dangerous to abandon. If I wasn’t locked inside one of these cubicles, the organic part of my brain dreaming, the rest helpless and inert, then the others weren’t here.

It was still hard to make myself cross the room and open the first door.

The plastic bed inside was empty, the power long cut off. I opened each one, but it was the same.

I stepped back from the last one. I wanted to bury my face in my hands, sink down to the floor, and slip into my media, but I didn’t. After twelve long seconds, the intense feeling subsided.

I don’t even know why I’d come in here. I needed to look for data storage, records left behind. I checked the weapons lockers to make sure there was nothing handy, like a package of drones, but they were empty. A firefight had left burn scars on the wall and there was a small crater impact from an explosive projectile next to one of the cubicles. Then I went back toward the offices.

I found the installation control center. Broken display surfaces were everywhere, chairs overturned, interfaces shattered on the floor, and a plastic cup still sat on a console, undisturbed, waiting for someone to pick it up again. Humans can’t work completely in the feed with multiple inputs the way I can, and bots like ART can. Some augmented humans have implanted interfaces that allow it, but not all humans want lots of things inserted into their brains, go figure. So they need these surfaces to project displays for group work. And the external data storage should be tied in here somewhere.

I picked a station, set a chair upright, and got out the small toolkit I had borrowed from ART’s crew storage and brought along in the large side pocket of my pants. (Armor doesn’t have pockets, so score one for ordinary human clothing.) I needed a power source to get the station operable again, but fortunately I had me.

I used the tools to open a port on the energy weapon in my right forearm. Doing it one-handed was tricky, but I’ve had to do worse. I used a patch cord to connect me to the console’s emergency power access and then the station hummed as it powered up. I couldn’t open the feed to control it directly, but I reached into the glittering projection and fished out the access for the Security Systems recorded storage. It had been wiped, but I’d been expecting that.

I started to check all the other storage, just in case it hadn’t been the company techs who had wiped SecSystem. The company wants everything recorded, work done in the feed, conversations, everything, so they can data mine it. A lot of that information is useless and gets deleted, but SecSystem has to hold on to it until the data mining bots can go over it, and so SecSystem often steals unused temporary storage space from other systems.

And there they were, files tucked into the MedSystem’s storage space for non-standard procedure downloads. (Presumably if MedSystem suddenly needed to download an emergency procedure for a patient, SecSystem would have whisked the files out and put them somewhere else, but sometimes it couldn’t act in time and chunks of recorded data would be lost. If you’re a SecUnit and you like your clients and want to keep something they’ve said or done (or that you’ve said or done) away from the company, this is one of the many ways you can make files accidentally disappear.)

SecSystem must have shifted files over right before the power failure. There was a lot of material and I skipped past random conversations and mining operations data to the end, then scrolled back a little. In the feed, two human techs had discussed an anomaly, some code that didn’t seem to be associated with any system, that had been uploaded on-site. They were trying to figure out where it had come from, and speculating, with a lot of profanity, that the installation had been bombed with malware. One tech said she was going to notify the supervisor, that they needed to sequester SecSystem, and the conversation ended there, in mid-word.

That was … not what I was expecting. I’d assumed a malfunction of my governor module had caused the massacre the company euphemistically referred to as an “incident.” But had I really taken out nine other SecUnits, plus all the bots and any armed humans who might have tried to stop me? I didn’t like my chances. If the other SecUnits had experienced the same malfunction, it had to come from an outside source.

I saved the conversation to my own storage, checked the other systems for stray files but found nothing, and unhooked myself from the console.

The security ready room had been stripped to the bone. But there were other places I could check. I pushed away from the console.

As I went through the other door, I noticed the impact points in the wall opposite, the stains on the floor. Someone—something capable of taking a high degree of injury had made a last stand here, trying to defend the control center. Maybe not all the SecUnits had been affected.

In the corridor near the living quarters, I found the other ready room, the one for the ComfortUnits.

Inside were four shapes that were clearly cubicles, but smaller. Their doors stood open, the plastic beds inside empty. In the corner there was space for a recycler, but no weapons lockers, and the storage cabinets were all different.

I stood in the center of the room. The cubicles for the murderbots had been closed, not in use. Which meant none of the SecUnits had been damaged and all had been either out on patrol, on guard, or in the ready room, probably standing around pretending not to stare at each other. But the cubicles for the s were open, which meant they had been inside when the emergency occurred and the power shut off. If the power is off, you can manually open a cubicle from the inside, but it won’t shut again.

It meant they had deployed during the “incident.”

I used the energy weapon in my arm again to power the first cubicle’s emergency data storage. I didn’t have anywhere near the energy needed to get the whole thing powered up, but the data storage box is for holding error and shutdown information if something goes wrong during a repair. (There are a lot of other things you can do with it if you’ve hacked your governor module, like use it to temporarily store your media so the human techs won’t find it.) SecSystem might have used it before its catastrophic failure.

It had been used. But by the ComfortUnits, to download their data during the incident.

It was patchy and hard to put together, until I realized the ComfortUnits had been communicating with each other.

I stood there for five hours and twenty-three minutes, putting the data fragments together.

There had been a code download from another mining installation for the ComfortUnits, supposedly a patch purchased from a third party ComfortUnit supplier. The ComfortUnits had all flagged it as non-standard and needing review by SecSystem and the human systems analyst, but the techs who had downloaded it ordered them to apply it. It turned out to be well-disguised malware. It hadn’t affected the ComfortUnits, but had used their feeds to jump to SecSystem and infect it. SecSystem had infected the SecUnits, bots, and drones, and everything capable of independent motion in the installation had lost its mind.

In between the running and shooting and the humans screaming in the background, the ComfortUnits had managed to analyze the malware and discover it was supposed to jump from them to the hauler bots and shut them down. This would disrupt operations so the other mining installation could get their shipment to the cargo transport first. This had been a sabotage attempt, not a mass murder. But a mass murder was what was happening.

The humans had managed to get an alert out to the port, but it was clear help would not arrive in time. The ComfortUnits noted that the SecUnits were not acting in concert, and were also attacking each other, while the bots randomly smashed into anything that moved. The ComfortUnits had decided that taking SecSystem back to factory default via its manual interface was their best option.

ComfortUnits are more physically powerful than a human, but not a SecUnit or bot. They had no inbuilt weapons, and while they could pick up a projectile or energy weapon and use it, they had no education modules on how the weapons worked. They could pick one up, try to aim it, pull the trigger, and hope the safety wasn’t engaged.

One by one the file downloads had stopped. One had signaled that it would try to decoy SecUnit attention away from the others, and three acknowledged. One had heard screams from the control center and diverted there to try to save the humans trapped inside, and two acknowledged. One had stayed at the entrance to a corridor to try to buy time to reach SecSystem, and one acknowledged. One reported reaching SecSystem, then nothing. 

I caught a low power warning from my own system and realized how long I had been here. I unhooked myself from the cubicle and left the room. I bumped into the edge of the doorway and the wall.

There must have been some off-the-books arrangement, maybe the installation who supplied the malware paid for the damages and the bonds, which might have been such a large amount that the installation had then failed and ceased operation. Maybe the company thought that was punishment enough.

I made my way back to the tube, climbed inside, and started a recharge cycle. Once I had enough capacity, I went back to episode 206 of Sanctuary Moon.

The tube ran out of power and died short of the access, but fortunately I was back up to 97 percent capacity by that time. I got out and ran the rest of the way. Running isn’t tiring for me the way it is for a human, but I reached the sealed access fifty-eight minutes later than I would have on the tube.

It had been a long, shitty cycle, and I was ready for it to be over with. I wanted to get off this mine only slightly less than I had probably wanted to get off it the first time I was here.

I had gotten back through the security barrier and was walking up the tunnel when I came within range of the feed again. I tapped ART to let it know I was back.

It said, We have a problem.

I located the problem in the lobby of the main hotel.

Tapan was on one of the upper platforms, seated on a round cushioned bench, her pack at her feet, partially screened by another holographic sculpture of a giant crystal formation. She looked up at me and said, “Oh, hi. I didn’t know if the others would be able to reach you.”

Without me present in the shuttle, ART hadn’t had any visual access to the passenger compartment. (As a private vehicle that was only being used as a public transport in a sketchy if not openly illegal way, it had no onboard security system or cameras.) ART hadn’t known Tapan wasn’t onboard until the shuttle reached the transit ring. Taking its responsibility seriously, it had sent a drone over to the embarkation area to watch my clients disembark and had seen an obviously distraught and angry Rami and Maro, but no Tapan. Then it had checked Eden’s profile on the social media feed and found the message from Rami. (Tapan had told them she was sick and was going to the shuttle’s restroom compartment. They hadn’t realized what had happened until the shuttle had cleared the port.)

I said, “They left me a message.” I had intended to just stand there and stare at her, which is what SecUnits do to clients who have just performed an act of stupidity so profound it approaches suicide which they ordered us not to stop them from doing. But she looked like she knew she had been stupid, and I had to know. “What happened?”

She looked up at me, clearly anticipating a negative reaction. “I got a note in my feed, through the social profile I had when we were working here. Someone working for Tlacey—a friend—said he had copies of the files and he’d give them to us.” She forwarded the message to my feed.

I checked it carefully. The meeting time was set for the next cycle.

I felt this would be the point where a human would sigh, so I sighed.

Tapan said, “I know it could be a trap, but, maybe it isn’t? I know him, he’s not the greatest guy, but he hates Tlacey.” She hesitated. “Will you help me? Please? I’ll understand if you say no. I know I’ve been … I know this could be a really bad idea.”

I had forgotten that I had a choice, that I wasn’t obligated to do what she wanted just because she was here. Being asked to stay, with a please and an option for refusal, hit me almost as hard as a human asking for my opinion and actually listening to me. I sighed again. I was having a lot of opportunities to do it and I think I was getting good at it. “I’ll help you. Right now we need to find a place to get out of sight.”

Tapan had a hard currency card from the transit ring, which wasn’t tied to any RaviHyral account and so was not traceable. At least, that’s what she thought and I hoped she was right. I had never been given any education modules on financial systems and since our modules were crap anyway, I’m not sure that would have helped. ART ran a search for me and the results were mixed. Hard currency cards could be traced, but usually only by non-corporate political or corporate entities. I decided it was probably all right to use it. If the message wasn’t a trap, Tlacey must think my clients were back on the transit ring by now. If it was a trap, they would know they could grab us when we walked into the meeting so there was no point in looking for us earlier.

Tapan used the card to pay for a transient room in the block next to the port. While she ran the card through the vending kiosk and got our room assignment, I stood behind her and surveyed the area. The transient rooms were in a narrow warren of corridors, as unlike the main hotel as a real cargo transport was unlike ART. There was no SecSystem to get control of and only one camera at the entrance. I deleted us out of its memory, but I still felt like we—or I—might have been observed at some point. It might just be inherent rogue-SecUnit-on-the-run paranoia.

Tapan led the way to our room. There were other humans hanging around the dimly lit corridors and some looked like they might try to approach her, then saw me and changed their minds. I was bigger than they were, and without cameras it was still hard to control my expression.

ART said, Tell the human not to touch any surfaces. There may be disease vectors present.

On the way here I had shared the recording of what I had found at Ganaka Pit. ART said, This is good news. You were not at fault. I agreed, sort of. I had been expecting to feel better about it. I mostly just felt awful.

Once inside the room with the door secured, I saw Tapan’s shoulders relax and she took a deep breath. The room was just a square box with pads stored in a cabinet for sitting or sleeping, and a small display surface. No cameras, no audio surveillance. There was a tiny attached bath, with a and a shower. At least it had a door. I was going to have to pretend to use it at least twice. Yes, that would be the cap on all the fun I was having today. I created a schedule and set an alarm to remind myself to do it.

Tapan dropped her bag on the floor and faced me. “I know you’re mad.”

I tried to moderate my expression. “I’m not mad.” I was furious. I thought my clients were safe, I was free to worry about my own problems, and now I had a tiny human to look after that I couldn’t possibly abandon.

She nodded and pushed her braids back. “I know—I mean—I’m sure Rami and Maro were furious. But it’s not like I’m not afraid, so that’s good.”

In my feed, ART said, What?

I have no idea, I told it. I said to Tapan, “How is that good?”

She explained, “In the creche, our moms always said that fear was an artificial condition. It’s imposed from the outside. So it’s possible to fight it. You should do the things you’re afraid of.”

If a bot with a brain the size of a transport could roll its eyes, that was what ART was doing. I said, “That isn’t the purpose of fear.” They didn’t give us an education module on human evolution, but I had looked it up in the HubSystem knowledge bases I’d had access to, in an effort to figure out what the hell was going on with humans. It hadn’t helped. 

She said, “I know, it’s supposed to be inspirational.” She looked around and went to the cabinet with the seating pads. She pulled them out, sniffed them suspiciously, then took an aerosol capsule out of a pocket on her pack and sprayed them down. “I forgot to ask, did you get a chance to do the research you wanted to do here?”

“Yes. It was … inconclusive.” It had been damningly conclusive, it just hadn’t had the revelatory effect I had been, stupidly, hoping for. I helped her pull the rest of the pads out.

We got them arranged on the floor and sat down. She looked at me and bit her lip. “You’re really augmented, aren’t you. Like, a lot. Like more than someone would choose voluntarily.”

It wasn’t a question. I said, “Um, yes.”

She nodded. “Was it an accident?”

I realized I had my arms wrapped around myself and was leaning over like I was trying to go into a fetal position. I don’t know why this was so stressful. Tapan wasn’t afraid of me. I had no reason to be afraid of her. Maybe it was being here again, seeing Ganaka Pit again. Some part of my organic systems remembered what had happened there. In the feed, ART started to play the soundtrack to Sanctuary Moon and weirdly, that helped. I said, “I got caught in an explosion. There’s not much of me that’s human, actually.”

Both those statements are true.

She stirred a little, as if debating what to say, then nodded again. “I’m sorry I got you into this. I know you know what you’re doing, but … I have to try, I have to see if this guy really has our files. Just this once, and then I’ll go back to the transit ring.”

In my feed, ART turned down the soundtrack to say, Young humans can be impulsive. The trick is keeping them around long enough to become old humans. This is what my crew tells me and my own observations seem to confirm it.

I couldn’t argue with the wisdom dispensed by ART’s absent crew. I remembered humans had needs and asked Tapan, “Did you eat?”

She had bought some meal packs with the hard currency card and had them stuffed in her bag. She offered me one and I told her my augments required me to have a special diet and it wasn’t time for me to eat yet. She accepted that readily. Humans apparently don’t like to discuss catastrophic injuries to digestive systems, so I didn’t need any of the corroborating detail ART had just researched for me. I asked her if she liked media and she said yes, so I sent some files to the display surface in the room, and we watched the first three episodes of Worldhoppers. ART was pleased, and I could feel it sitting in my feed, comparing Tapan’s reactions to the show to mine.

When Tapan said she wanted to try to sleep, I shut down the display. She curled up on her pad and I lay down on mine and continued watching in the feed with ART.

Two hours and forty-three minutes later, I caught a ping from right outside the door.

I sat up so abruptly, Tapan woke with a start. I motioned for her to be quiet, and she subsided back on the pad, curling around her pack, looking worried. I stood and went to the door, listening. I couldn’t hear any breathing, but there was a change in the background noise that told me there was something solid on the other side of the metal door. Cautiously, I did a limited scan.

Yes, there was something out there, but no sign of weapons. I checked the ping and saw it had the same signature as the ping I had caught in the public area during the meeting with Tlacey.

The  was standing on the other side of the door.

It couldn’t have been following me all this time. It could have been watching for me on the security cameras, tracking me sporadically through the port when I came back within range. That was not a comforting thought.

It had to belong to Tlacey. If it had been watching me, it would have missed Tapan’s unexpected exit from the private shuttle but would have seen her again when we met up at the main hotel or on the way here. Damn it.

But now I knew that. If it hadn’t pinged me, I wouldn’t have realized it was in play. Why is it here? I asked ART.

I assume that’s a rhetorical question, it said.

There was only one way to find out. I acknowledged the ping.

The moment stretched. Then it reached out to my feed. It was cautious, the connection almost tentative. It said, I know what you are. Who sent you?

I replied, I’m on contract to a private individual. Why are you communicating with me?

SecUnits on the same contract don’t talk, either verbally or on the feed, unless they absolutely have to in order to perform their duties. Communicating with units on different contracts has to be done through the controlling HubSystems. And SecUnits don’t interact with ComfortUnits anyway. Could this be a rogue ? If it was rogue, why was it here on RaviHyral? I didn’t know why anybody would stay here voluntarily, including the humans. No, it made more sense if Tlacey owned its contract, and had sent it here to kill Tapan.

If it tried to attack my client, I would tear it apart.

Tapan, sitting on the pad and watching me worriedly, mouthed the words, “What is it?”

I opened a secure channel to her and said, Someone is outside the door. I’m not sure why.

That was mostly true. I didn’t want to tell Tapan what it was, since that seemed to lead directly to me telling her what I was, which I didn’t want to do. Though if I had to destroy it in front of her, I was going to have a lot of explaining to do.

The  replied, This is you, and sent me a copy of a public newsburst.

It was from the station, from Port FreeCommerce. This time the headline was “Authorities Admit a SecUnit Unsecured and Location Unknown.”

Uh-oh, ART said.

I closed the story by reflex, like that would make it not exist. After three seconds of shock, I made myself open it again.

“Unsecured” is what they call rogue SecUnits when they want humans to listen and not just start screaming. It meant that the knowledge that I had hacked my governor module was no longer confined to me and the members of PreservationAux. They must have been at the stage where everyone in the two survey groups who had survived was being interviewed, and they would have had to guarantee bonds to assert they were telling the truth.

So the company knew now that I had hacked my governor module. That was terrifying, even though I had expected it. It was one of the reasons Mensah had made sure to get me off inventory and out of the deployment center as soon as I came out of repair and reconstruction mode.

Expecting it and having it happen were two different things, something I learned the first time I got shot to pieces.

I skimmed the story in dread and then read it again, closely. The solicitors for several sides in the ongoing legal and civil battles had asked Preservation to produce the SecUnit who had recorded all the damning evidence against GrayCris. This was unusual. It’s not like SecUnits can testify in courts. Our recordings are admissible, just like recordings from a drone or security camera or any other inert device, but it’s not like we’re supposed to have opinions or a perspective on what we record.

After some back and forth, Mensah’s solicitor had admitted that she had lost track of me. They phrased it as “released on my own recognizance, as constructs are considered legal sentients under Preservation law,” but the journalists hadn’t been fooled by that, either. There were a lot of sidebar links to attached articles about constructs, about SecUnits, about rogue SecUnits. There was no mention that this particular unit had had a little problem with murdering the clients supposedly under its protection before, but I had the feeling the company had probably already destroyed any records relating to Ganaka Pit so they couldn’t be produced under court injunction. 

Tapan whispered, “Are you talking to them, the person?”

“Yes,” I told her. To the , I said, That’s an interesting story but it has nothing to do with me.

It said, It’s you. Who sent you?

I said, That’s a story about a dangerous rogue SecUnit. No one would send it anywhere.

I’m not asking because I want to report you. I won’t tell anyone. I’m asking—There’s no human controlling you? You’re free?

I could feel ART in my feed, carefully extending itself out toward the .

I have a client, I told it. I had to distract it, if ART was going to be able to get any info. Even though it was a , it was still a construct, still a whole different proposition from a pilot bot. Who sent you here? Was it Tlacey?

Yes. She is my client.

As a ComfortUnit, not a SecUnit. Sending a ComfortUnit into this situation was morally irresponsible and a clear violation of contract. I’m guessing the  knew that.

ART said, It’s not rogue. Its governor module is engaged. So it’s probably telling the truth.

I asked ART, Can you hack it from here?

There was a half-second pause while ART explored the idea. ART answered, No, I can’t secure the connection here. It could stop me by cutting off its feed.

I told the , Your client wants to kill my client.

It didn’t reply.

I said, You told Tlacey about me. It must have recognized what I was during that first meeting. If it hadn’t been sure, seeing the damage I had done to the three humans Tlacey had sent would have been all the confirmation it needed. I was seething, but I kept it out of the feed. As I told ART, bots and constructs can’t trust each other, so I don’t know why it made me angry. I wish being a construct made me less irrational than the average human but you may have noticed this is not the case. I said, Your client sent a ComfortUnit to do a SecUnit’s job.

It countered, She didn’t know she needed a SecUnit until today. It added, I told her you were a SecUnit, I didn’t tell her you were a rogue.

I wondered if I could believe that. And I wondered if it had tried to explain to Tlacey the impossibility of this assignment. What do you propose to do?

There was a pause. A long one, five seconds. We could kill them.

Well, that was an unusual approach to its dilemma. Kill who? Tlacey?

All of them. The humans here.

I leaned against the wall. If I had been human, I would have rolled my eyes. Though if I had been human, I might have been stupid enough to think it was a good idea.

I also wondered if it knew a lot more about me than what little was in the newsburst.

Picking up on my reaction, ART said, What does it want?

To kill all the humans, I answered.

I could feel ART metaphorically clutch its function. If there were no humans, there would be no crew to protect and no reason to do research and fill its databases. It said, That is irrational.

I know, I said, if the humans were dead, who would make the media? It was so outrageous, it sounded like something a human would say.

Huh.

I said to the , Is that how Tlacey thinks constructs talk to each other?

There was another pause, only two seconds this time. Yes. Then, Tlacey believes you stayed behind to steal the files for the tech group. What did you do for so long in the feed blackout area?

I was hiding. I know, not my best lie. Does Tlacey know you want to kill her? Because the “kill all humans” thing might have come from Tlacey, but the intensity under it was real, and I didn’t think it was directed at all humans.

She knows, it said. Then I didn’t tell her about your client, she thinks they all left on the shuttle. She only wanted me to follow you.

A code bundle came through the feed. You can’t infect a construct with malware like that, not without sending it through a Sec or HubSystem. Even then I would have to apply it, and without direct orders and a working governor module, there’s no way to force me to do it. The only way that code can be applied without my assistance is through a combat override module via my dataport.

It might be killware, but I was not a simple pilot bot, and it would mostly just annoy the hell out of me. Maybe to the point where I tore a door off the wall and ripped the head off a ComfortUnit.

I could just delete the bundle, but I wanted to know what it was so I knew how furious to get. It was small enough for a human’s interface to handle, so I shunted it aside to Tapan. I said aloud, “I need you to isolate that for me. Don’t open it yet.”

She signaled assent through the feed and pulled the bundle into her temp storage. The other thing about killware and malware is that they can’t do anything to humans or augmented humans.

The  hadn’t said anything else and I sent a ping in time to feel it withdraw its feed. It was walking away down the corridor.

I waited until I was sure, then stepped back from the door. I debated staying here, or moving Tapan. Now that I knew something was hacking the security cameras to watch me, I could use countermeasures. I probably should have been doing that from the beginning, but you may have noticed that for a terrifying murderbot I fuck up a lot.

“It’s gone,” I told Tapan. “Can you check out that code bundle for me?”

She got that inward look that humans have when they’re deep in their feed. After a minute, she said, “It’s malware. Pretty standard … Maybe they thought it would get your augments, but that’s kind of amateurish for Tlacey. Hold it. There’s a message string in here, attached to the code.”

ART and I waited. Tapan’s face did something complicated, settling on worry. “This is weird.” She turned to the display surface and made the completely unnecessary gesture that some humans can’t help doing when they send something from their feed to display.

It was the message string, three words. Please help me.

I moved us to a different room, near an emergency exit, in another section of the hostel. The  might be alert for hacking, so I removed the access plate, manually broke the lock, and replaced the plate again while Tapan watched the corridor. Once we were inside, I told Tapan some of what the  had said, mostly the part about how it claimed Tlacey didn’t know Tapan was here. (I didn’t tell her our visitor had been a  because Tlacey had figured out what I was and didn’t want to waste any more human bodyguards on me.) “But we don’t know that that’s true, or that this operative won’t tell Tlacey you’re here now.”

Tapan looked confused. “But why did they tell you anything?”

That was a good question. “I don’t know. They don’t like Tlacey, but that might not be the only reason.”

Tapan bit her lip, considering. “I think I should still try to keep the meeting. It’s only four hours from now.”

I’m used to humans wanting to do things that can get them killed. Maybe too used to it. I knew we should leave now. But I needed time to hack enough of the security system to get past the . Once I did that, it seemed wrong not to wait the short time to make the meeting, which Tapan was reasonably sure Tlacey didn’t know about. Reasonably sure.

It was probably a trap.

I needed to think. I told Tapan I was going to sleep for a while and laid down on my side on my section of padding. My recharge cycle isn’t obvious but it doesn’t look like a human sleeping, so what I was actually going to do was play some media in the background of my feed while I worked on my security countermeasures and looked up my old module on risk assessment. 

Thirty-two minutes later, I heard movement. I thought Tapan was getting up to go to the restroom facility, but then she settled on the pads behind me, not quite touching my back. I had set my breathing to sound deep and even, like a human sleeping, with occasional random variations to add verisimilitude, so the fact that I had frozen in place wasn’t obvious.

I had never had a human touch me, or almost touch me, like this before and it was deeply, deeply weird.

Calm down, ART said, not helpfully.

I was too frozen to respond. After three seconds, ART added, She’s frightened. You are a reassuring presence.

I was still too frozen to answer ART, but I upped my body heat. Over the next two hours, she yawned twice, breathed deeply, and snorted occasionally. At the end of that time I changed my breathing and moved a little, and she immediately slid off my pad and over to hers.

By that time, I had a plan, sort of.

I convinced Tapan that I should go to the meeting, and she should get on a public shuttle to the transit ring immediately. She was reluctant. “I don’t want to abandon you,” she said. “You’re only involved in this because of us.”

That hit home so hard my insides clenched. I had to lean over and pretend to look through my bag to hide my expression. Company emergency protocol allows clients to abandon their SecUnits if necessary, even in situations where the company might never be able to retrieve them. Tapan was making me think of Mensah, yelling that she wouldn’t leave me. I said, “It’ll help me the most if you go back to the transit ring.”

It took a while, but I finally convinced her this was for the best for both of us.

Tapan left the hostel first, wearing both extra jackets from her pack to change her body shape and with the hood of one pulled up to conceal her hair and shadow her face. (This was mostly to make her feel more confident, and because I didn’t want to explain the extent to which I could gain temporary control over portions of RaviHyral’s admittedly not-great security system.) I watched her on the security cameras until I saw her reach the public dock about one hundred meters away, go down the walkway to the embarkation area, then board the shuttle that was scheduled to leave in twenty-one minutes. ART sent me an acknowledgment as it slid into the shuttle’s controls to guard the bot pilot again. Then I left the hostel.

I’d prepared a hack for the security cameras that was much more sophisticated than the one I’d been using up to this point. It involved getting into the operational code and setting the system on a tenth of a second delay, then deleting Tapan out and randomly replacing that part of the recording with pieces cut from earlier. This would work because the  would be scanning the recordings the same way I would, using a body configuration scan. I didn’t match SecUnit standard anymore, but the  had had plenty of time to scan my new configuration during that first meeting with Tlacey.

Right now I wanted the ’s attention on me, and not the public dock. I let the cameras track me out of the port and back toward the tube access. Then I started the hack.

I was only 97 percent certain this meeting was a trap.

When I reached the small food service counter in the contractor district, a human was there who matched the image Tapan had sent to my feed. As I sat down at the table he looked up at me, his expression nervous, sweat beading on his pale forehead. I said, “Tapan couldn’t come,” and sent his feed the brief recording Tapan had made with her interface. It was her standing next to me in the room at the hostel, holding my arm and explaining that the files could be given to me. Wow, I looked uncomfortable.

His gaze went inward as he reviewed the recording, then his body relaxed a little. He slid a memory clip over to me. I took it and checked the cameras.

Nothing. No potential threats, no one showing interest in us. The counter served drinks with a lot of bubbles in them and fried protein in the shape of water fauna and flora. Everyone else was busy eating or talking. There was no one suspicious in the corridor or mall area outside, no one watching, no one waiting.

This was not a trap.

The human said uncertainly, “Should we order something? To make it look like we’re not—you know?”

I told him, “No one’s watching, you can leave,” and pushed to my feet. I had to get back to the port.

If this wasn’t a trap, the real trap was somewhere else.

On the way back to the dock, I checked the schedule. The shuttle was now listed as delayed.

As I reached the embarkation area, I was reviewing the security recording from the time Tapan had boarded the shuttle. On visual, I spotted the  coming toward me from the far end of the walkway.

I had gotten to the point in the recording where two humans with Port Authority identification had stopped the shuttle’s departure and removed Tapan. ART slid out of the shuttle and back into my feed. It said, If I had my armed drones, this would be easier.

When the  reached me, I said, “Where is she?”

“In Tlacey’s private shuttle. I’ll show you.”

I followed it along the walkway, then down the ramp that split off toward the private shuttle docks. ART said, Why is it showing you where your human is?

I said, Because Tlacey doesn’t want Tapan, she wants me.

ART was quiet as we went past the private shuttle slots toward the bigger, more expensive section at the end. Then it said, Retrieve your human and make Tlacey regret this.

We stopped in front of the access to a shuttle hatch. No one was outside, and most of the activity was down toward the other end of the docks. The  turned to face me.

It opened its hand, and I recognized the small object. It was a combat override module. It said, “They won’t allow you aboard unless you let me install this.”

In my feed, ART said, Ah.

They wanted us in the shuttle so that they could dispose of the bodies. Or Tapan’s body. Me they obviously intended to keep.

A combat override module contains code that will take over my system, overriding the governor module and the company factory-set protocols, and placing me under the direct verbal or comm control of whoever the module designates. This was how GrayCris took over DeltFall’s SecUnits, and tried to take over me.

I said, “If I accept that, will they release my client?”

In the feed the  whispered, You know they won’t. Aloud, it said, “Yes.”

I turned and let it insert the module into my data port. (The data port that ART had disconnected when it altered my configuration. With my governor module hacked, it had been the only way left to assert control over me, so disabling it had been a priority.)

The module clicked into place and I had a moment of purely irrational fear. ART must have picked up on it because it said, Please, my MedSystem makes no mistakes. Nothing happened, and from the security camera I had control of, I saw that I managed to keep the relief out of my expression.

The ’s expression was Unit standard neutral, and I followed it into the shuttle. A human stood just inside the lock, armed, his eyes flicking nervously between me and the . He said, “Is it under control?”

“Yes,” the  said.

He stepped back and his jaw moved as he spoke in his feed. I couldn’t hack anything without the  knowing, so I waited. I kept my expression blank. I had no way of knowing what the combat override module was supposed to make me do, but I was assuming it would put me under Tlacey’s control. I suspected the humans, and the , weren’t sure what the outward effect would be. 

Once we were through the lock, it cycled shut and a launch warning went through the feed, ending in an audible beep from the comm system. Tlacey must have bribed someone for immediate clearance, because there was a clunk as the lock disengaged and then the shuttle slid out of its slot.

I have you on my scan, ART said.

The human led the way through the shuttle. It was a large model, and the access corridor went past hatchways to cabins and the engineering section before ending in a big compartment. There was cushioned bench seating against the walls and acceleration chairs to the front, near the hatch that must lead to the forward part of the ship. There were six unknown humans in the room, four armed and two unarmed crew. One of the armed humans held Tapan by the shoulder and had a projectile weapon pressed to her head.

Tlacey stood up from a chair and looked me over with a smile. She said, “Take little Tapan to a cabin. I’ll want to talk to her later about her work.”

Tapan’s eyes were wide and frightened. I kept my expression blank. She tried to say, “Eden, I’m sorry! I’m sorry—” but the guard pulled her through another hatchway and down a corridor. I didn’t react, since I wanted her out of the line of fire. I listened for the hatch to close, then focused on Tlacey.

She strolled toward me, thoughtful now. I guess the triumphant smile had been for Tapan’s benefit. The two other unarmed humans were watching with nervous curiosity, the armed guards still looked cautious. To the , Tlacey said, “You really think this is one of the units from the Ganaka Pit accident?”

The  started to reply, and I said, “But we all know that wasn’t an accident, don’t we.”

Now I had everybody’s attention.

I kept my gaze straight ahead, a good SecUnit still under the control of the combat override module. Tlacey stared at me, then her eyes narrowed. “Who am I talking to?”

That was almost funny. “You think I’m a puppet? You know that’s not the way we work.”

Tlacey was beginning to be afraid. “Who sent you?”

I lowered my head to meet her gaze. “I came for my client.”

Tlacey’s jaw moved as she gave a command in the feed, and the  started to shift sideways into a combat position.

ART said, The shuttle is clear of the port and moving into an orbit around the moon. Do you have a moment to let me in?

I said, Be fast, and let ART in. I had the sensation again, my head shoved underwater, being temporarily incapacitated as ART used me as a bridge to reach the bot controlling the shuttle.

It was quick, but the  had time to punch me in the jaw. Tlacey must have ordered that; it wasn’t the way a unit would attack another unit. It hurt, but only in the way that would piss me off. When I didn’t react immediately, Tlacey relaxed and grinned. “I like a mouthy bot. This is going to be interesting—”

ART was in the shuttle’s systems and I was clear. I caught the ’s arm and flung it across the room toward the three armed guards. One went down, one stumbled into a chair, the third started to lift his weapon. I knocked Tlacey out of my way and stepped on the  as I went over it, thumping it back down to the deck. I grabbed the muzzle of the energy weapon and shoved it upright just as he fired. The discharge struck the curved ceiling. I ripped it out of his grasp, dislocating his shoulder and at least three fingers, and slammed his head down on the console.

The guard who had already fallen to the deck had a projectile weapon and I felt two impacts, one to my side and one to my thigh. Now that’s the kind of attack that actually hurts. I extended my right arm and fired my inbuilt energy weapon, catching him with two bolts in the chest. I stepped sideways to avoid an energy weapon blast from the guard who had fallen into the chair, and my third shot hit him in the shoulder. I had the blasts set to narrow, and they created deep burn wounds that usually incapacitated humans rapidly with shock and pain and, you know, having holes burned into their chest cavities.

I pivoted and threw the captured gun as a distraction. The first unarmed human was on the deck, a smoking wound in her back; the guard who had missed me had shot her. The second flung herself across the compartment to try to grab a fallen projectile weapon, so I shot her in the shoulder and the leg.

The  rolled to its feet and charged me, I caught it, went down on my back, and flung it off and over my head. I twisted around and up to my knees but couldn’t get all the way up due to the wound in my right thigh. The  shoved upright and I grabbed its leg and popped the knee out of the socket. It went down and I took out its left shoulder joint. Slamming it down to the deck, I turned to see Tlacey reaching for one of the fallen weapons. I said, “Touch that weapon and I’ll take it away from you and insert it into your rib cage.”

She froze. She was panting from fear, eyes staring. I said, “Tell your  to stop fighting.”

It was still struggling to get up and it was just going to hurt itself further. Especially if it made me mad again.

Tlacey straightened slowly, her jaw working, and the  relaxed. I said, ART, cut off Tlacey’s feed.

Done, ART said.

Tlacey winced as her feed went down. I told Tlacey, “Give the  a verbal command to obey me until further notice. Try to give it any other command and I’ll rip your tongue out.”

Tlacey huffed out a breath, then said, “Unit, obey the crazy rogue SecUnit until further notice.” To me, she said, “You need to get better threats.”

I put a hand on the nearest chair seat and shoved myself to my feet. “I don’t make threats, I’m just telling you what I’m going to do.”

Her jaw hardened. Two of the humans in the room had stopped breathing, the unarmed one that the guard had shot while aiming for me and the first one I had shot. Tlacey hadn’t noticed.

I looked down at the , which looked up at me. “Stay down,” I said.

It sent me an acknowledgment. I stepped over it, grabbed Tlacey’s arm, and dragged her down the corridor to the cabin where her guard had taken Tapan.

She said quickly, “So you’re a free agent, right? I can give you a job. Whatever you want—”

I thought, You don’t have anything I want. I said, “All you had to do was give them the fucking files and none of us would be in this situation.”

The look she threw back at me was startled, incredulous. I didn’t sound like her idea of a SecUnit, rogue or otherwise, I guess.

Humans should really do more research. There were operating manuals that would have warned her not to fuck with us.

Tlacey stopped at a closed hatch, said, “Bassom, it’s me,” and hit the release. The door slid up.

Tapan was half sprawled across the bunk on the far wall, blood spreading across the flower pattern on her T-shirt, drops of it splashed on the brown skin of the bare arm pressed against the wound in her side. Her raspy breath sounded loud in the small cabin. The bodyguard stared at us, eyes wide.

“He panicked when he heard the shots,” Tlacey gasped. “You can’t—”

Oh yeah, I could.

I swung Tlacey to shield me as the bodyguard brought up his weapon. Multiple shots hit her back but I’d already crushed her windpipe. I took another projectile in the chest as I crossed the cabin, threw him against the wall, jammed my arm up under his chin, and triggered my energy weapon. 

I stepped back and let his body drop.

I turned away from it and leaned over Tapan. I said, stupidly, “It’s me.” Her eyes were shut and she was breathing through gritted teeth. I clamped my hand over the wound to stop the bleeding and said, ART, help.

ART said, I’ve been guiding the shuttle toward the transit ring, where I can dock it with myself. ETA is seventeen minutes. MedSystem is prepping for your arrival.

I sank down beside Tapan. She was just conscious enough to reach over and squeeze my hand. I pulled the useless combat override module out of the back of my neck and tossed it away.

I had made a huge mistake, which seemed blindingly obvious in hindsight. I had known the invitation to exchange the signing bonus for the files was a trap from the beginning and I should have convinced Rami and the others not to return to RaviHyral. The augmented human security consultant I was pretending to be would have done that. I was used to taking orders from humans and trying to mitigate whatever damage their stupid ideas did to them, but I had wanted to work with a group again, I had enjoyed how they had listened to me, I had put my need to get to RaviHyral above the safety of my clients.

I was just as shit at being a security consultant as any human.

By the time we were on approach to the transit ring, ART had cleared us with the ring’s Port Authority. Shuttles weren’t supposed to be able to dock with transports without advance notice, but ART took care of approach permission, and forged its captain’s feed signature to pay the fine for not giving prior notice of the scheduled trip. They didn’t suspect anything; nobody knew transports could have bots sophisticated enough to fake being human in the feed. I sure hadn’t known it.

The locks weren’t compatible but ART solved that problem by pulling the shuttle into an empty module meant for lab space. It sat us down, filled the module with atmosphere, and then cycled our lock. I got upright and carried Tapan out and up the access into the main section. ComfortUnit followed me.

The MedSystem was ready by the time I walked in and laid Tapan down on the platform. Drones whizzed around me and I picked up the MedSystem feed’s instruction to remove her shoes and clothes. As the cradle closed around her, I sank down beside the platform.

She was out now, the MedSystem keeping her under while it finished its assessment and started to work. Two medical drones flew around me, one diving in toward my shoulder and the other poking at the wound in my thigh. I ignored them.

A larger drone flew in, carrying Tapan’s bag, her blood-stained jacket, and my knapsack. ART flashed me a view of the other drones still inside the shuttle. Four of the humans in the shuttle were still alive, though unconscious. ART had sent drones to scrub and sterilize away my fluids and Tapan’s blood from the shuttle’s interior. ART had already wiped the bot pilot’s memory and deleted any security data. It was also chatting casually with transit ring launch authority with a forged feed signature from one of the dead humans.

I watched as the drones finished and retreated, then ART sealed the shuttle again and launched it with a filed flight plan back to RaviHyral. The onboard bot pilot would land it, full of terribly injured humans, and no one would know they hadn’t done it to each other until they were all conscious and told their stories. Though maybe some wouldn’t want to tell the story of how they had helped kidnap another human. Whatever happened, it would give us all time to get out of here.

I asked ART, How did you know to do that? though I already knew the answer.

It knew I knew, but it said, Episode 179 of The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.

ComfortUnit knelt beside me. “Can I help?”

“No.” The medical drones were clamped onto me now, digging for the projectiles, and I was leaking onto ART’s pristine MedSystem floor. The anesthetic was making me numb. “How did you know I was one of the Ganaka Pit units?”

It said, “I saw you get off the tube access in that section. There’s nothing else down there. It’s not in the historical database anymore, but the humans still tell each other horror stories about it. If you were really a rogue and not under orders to go there, then there was an eighty-six percent chance that you went there because you were one of the units involved.”

I believed it. “Drop your wall.”

It did, and I rode the feed into its brain. I could feel ART with me, alert for traps. But I found the governor module, rendered it null, and slid back out into my own body again.

The ComfortUnit had fallen back, sitting down on the deck with a thump, staring at me.

I said, “Go away. Don’t let me see you again. Don’t hurt anyone on this transit ring or I’ll find you.”

It shoved upright, unsteady. More of ART’s drones flicked through the air, making sure it didn’t try to damage anything, herding it toward the door. It followed the drones out into the corridor. Through ART’s feed I watched it go through to the main hatch, where the lock cycled and it went out into the transit ring.

ART watched it walk away through its lock camera. It said, I thought you might destroy it.

Too tired and numb to talk, I signaled a negative through the feed. It hadn’t had a choice. And I hadn’t broken its governor module for its sake. I did it for the four ComfortUnits at Ganaka Pit who had no orders and no directive to act and had voluntarily walked into the meat grinder to try to save me and everyone else left alive in the installation.

ART said, Now get on the other platform. The shuttle will land soon and there is a great deal of evidence to destroy.

When Tapan woke, I was sitting on the MedSystem’s platform holding her hand. The MedSystem had taken care of my wounds, and I’d cleaned off all the blood. The projectiles that had hit me and the energy bursts from my own weapons had left holes in my clothes, and ART had produced a new set for me from its recycler. It was basically ART’s crew uniform without the logos: pants with lots of sealable pockets, a long-sleeved shirt with a collar just high enough to cover my data port, and a soft hooded jacket, all of it either dark blue or black. I fed my bloody clothes into the recycler so the levels would be neutral and ART wouldn’t have to forge its log.

Tapan blinked up at me, confused. “Um,” she said, and squeezed my hand. The drugs made her expression bleary. “What happened?”

I said, “They tried to kill us again. We had to leave. We’re back on the transit ring, on my friend’s ship.”

Her eyes widened as she remembered. She winced, and muttered, “Fuckers.”

“Your friend was telling the truth, he gave me your files.” I held up the memory clip, and showed her I was putting it into the interface pocket in her bag. I’d checked it already for malware or tracers. “This ship has to leave soon. I need you to call Rami and Maro to come meet us outside the embarkation zone.”

“Okay.” She fumbled at her ear, and I handed her the blue feed interface. One of ART’s drones had found it in Tlacey’s pocket. She took it, started to put it back in her ear, and hesitated. “They’re going to be so mad.”

“Yeah, they are.” I thought they would be so glad to have her alive it wouldn’t occur to them to be angry.

She winced again. “I’m sorry. I should have listened to you.” 

“It wasn’t your fault.”

Her brow crinkled. “I kind of think it was.”

“It was my fault.”

“It’s both our faults then, but we won’t tell anybody,” Tapan decided, and wiggled the interface into her ear.

I did a quick walk-through of the areas of the ship I had used, to make sure nothing was out of place. ART’s drones had already come through, taking Tapan’s bloody clothes to be cleaned and sterilizing surfaces so any attempt to collect trace evidence would fail. Not that ART intended to be here when the investigation started. We were all leaving immediately, but ART believed in contingency plans. I started to remove the comm interface ART had given me. “You need to clean this, too.”

No, ART said. Keep it. Maybe we’ll come within range of each other again.

The MedSystem had already sterilized itself and deleted the records of my configuration change and the emergency trauma treatments to both me and Tapan. I was waiting for her when she came out of the bath facility. Drones followed her in to clean away any traces of her presence, and she said, “I’m ready.” She had stuffed her old clothes into her pack and was wearing fresh ones. She still looked a little bleary.

We walked out together and the lock sealed behind us. I had the cameras in the embarkation zone and ART was already doctoring the security recordings on its lock to erase our presence.

We met Rami, Maro, and the rest of their group at a food stand outside the embarkation zone. Rami had messaged me that they had already bought passage on a passenger transport leaving within the hour. They greeted Tapan enthusiastically, with tears and admonishments to each other not to squeeze her too hard.

I’d told them already not to talk about it in public. Rami turned and handed me a hard currency card. “Your friend Art said this was a good way to pay you.”

“Right.” I took it and tucked it in a sealable pocket.

They were all watching me now and it was a little nerve-racking. Rami said, “So, you’re going?”

I had my eye on a cargo transport heading the right direction. With luck I should be leaving within minutes of their departure. “Yes, I should hurry.”

“Can we hug you?” Maro let go of Tapan and faced me.

“Uh.” I didn’t step back, but it must have been obvious the answer was no.

Maro nodded. “Okay. This is for you.” She wrapped her arms around herself and squeezed.

I said, “I’ve got to go,” and walked away down the mall.

Fading, already disengaging from its lock, ART said in my feed, Be careful. Find your crew.

I tapped the feed in acknowledgment, because if I tried to say anything else I was going to sound stupid and emotional.

I didn’t know what I was going to do now, if I was going to go ahead with my plan or not. I had hoped finding out what had happened at Ganaka Pit would clear everything up, but maybe revelations like that only happened in the media.

Speaking of which, I needed to grab some more downloads before my next transport left. It was going to be a long trip.

I have the worst luck with bot-driven transports.

The first one had let me stow away in exchange for my collection of media files, with no ulterior motives, and had been so focused on its function that there had been hardly more communication between us than you’d have with a hauler bot. For the duration of the trip I had been alone with my media storage, just the way I like it. It had spoiled me into thinking all bot transports would be like that.

Then there was Asshole Research Transport. ART’s official designation was deep space research vessel. At various points in our relationship, ART had threatened to kill me, watched my favorite shows with me, given me a body configuration change, provided excellent tactical support, talked me into pretending to be an augmented human security consultant, saved my clients’ lives, and had cleaned up after me when I had to murder some humans. (They were bad humans.) I really missed ART.

Then there was this transport.

It was also bot-driven, no crew, but it carried passengers, mostly minimum to moderately skilled tech workers, human and augmented human, traveling to and from transit stations on temporary work contracts. This was not an ideal situation for me, but it was the only transport going in the right direction.

Like bot-transports that were not ART, it communicated in images and had allowed me onboard in exchange for a copy of my stored media. Because the manifest was in the transport’s feed and so available to the other passengers, I asked it to list me for the duration of the voyage in case anybody checked. There was a field in the passenger form for occupation and in a moment of weakness, I told it I was a security consultant.

Transport decided that meant it could use me as onboard security and started alerting me to problems among the passengers. I was an idiot and started responding. No, I don’t know why, either. Maybe because it was what I was constructed to do and it must be written into the DNA that controls my organic parts. (There needs to be an error code that means “I received your request but decided to ignore you.”)

Initially, it had been pretty easy. (“If you bother her again I will break every individual bone in your hand and arm. It will take about an hour.”) Then it had gotten more complicated as even the passengers who liked each other started to get into fights. I spent a lot of time (valuable time I could have been viewing/reading my saved entertainment media) arbitrating arguments I didn’t give a shit about.

Now it was the last cycle of the trip, all of us somehow having managed to survive, and I was heading into the mess compartment to break up yet another fight between idiot humans.

Transport didn’t have drones, but it did have a limited range of security cameras, so I knew the positions of everybody in the galley/mess area before the door slid open. I strode across the room, through the maze of shouting humans and overturned tables and chairs, and stepped between the two combatants. One had picked up a food utensil as a weapon and in one careful non-finger-ripping-off twist I had it, instead.

You would think the person they knew as a security consultant slamming in and disarming one of them would cause everyone to stop and reassess their priorities in this situation, but oh, you would be wrong. They staggered back, still screaming profanity at each other. The others in the room switched from shouting profanity at the combatants to shouting at me, all trying to tell me different versions of what had happened. I yelled, “Shut up!”

(The good thing about pretending to be an augmented human security consultant instead of a construct SecUnit is that you can tell the humans to shut up.)

Everybody shut up.

Then, still breathing hard, Ayres said, “Consultant Rin, I thought you said you didn’t want to come back up here—”

The other one, Elbik, was pointing dramatically. “Consultant Rin, he said he was going to—”

I’d had Transport list my name as Rin on the manifest though I’d used Eden at RaviHyral. I was fairly certain RaviHyral transit station security had no reason to associate that identity with any sudden deaths taking place on a private shuttle, and even if they had, wouldn’t pursue anyone out of their jurisdiction unless contracted to. But it had seemed best to change it.

The others, starting to come out from behind tables and hastily assembled chair barricades, all tried to chime in, and there was more pointing and shouting. This was typical. (If it wasn’t for the shows I download from the entertainment feed, I would have thought the only way most humans knew how to communicate was by pointing and shouting.)

The objective twenty-six cycles of the journey had felt like a subjective two hundred and thirty, at least. I had tried to distract them. I had copied all my visual media into Transport’s passenger-accessible system so it could be played on all their display surfaces, which at least kept the crying to a minimum (for children and adults). And, granted, the fighting had decreased dramatically after the first time I pinned someone to a wall with one hand and established a clear set of rules. (Rule Number One: do not touch Security Consultant Rin.) But even that usually left me standing there helplessly listening to their problems and their grievances against each other, against various corporations they had been fucked over by (yeah, tell me about it), and against existence in general. Yes, listening to it was excruciating.

Today, I said, “I don’t care.”

Everybody shut up again.

I continued, “We have, at most, six hours left before this transport will dock. After that, you can do whatever you want to each other.”

That didn’t work, they still had to tell me about what had caused the latest fight. (I don’t remember what it was, I deleted it from memory as soon as I could get out of the room.)

They were all annoying and deeply inadequate humans, but I didn’t want to kill them. Okay, maybe a little.

A SecUnit’s job is to protect its clients from anything that wants to kill or hurt them, and to gently discourage them from killing, maiming, etc., each other. The reason why they were trying to kill, maim, etc., each other wasn’t the SecUnit’s problem, it was for the humans’ supervisor to deal with. (Or to willfully ignore until the whole project devolved into a giant clusterfuck and your SecUnit prayed for the sweet relief of a massive accidental explosive decompression, not that I’m speaking from experience or anything.)

But here on this transport, there was no supervisor, just me. And I knew where they were going, and they knew where they were going, even if they were pretending all their anger and frustration was caused by Vinigo or Eva taking an extra simulated fruit pac. So I listened to them a lot and pretended to be launching major investigations into incidents like who left a cracker wrapper in the galley restroom sink.

They were heading to a labor installation on some shitshow world. Ayres told me they had all sold their personal labor for a twenty-year hitch, with a big payout at the end. He was aware it was a terrible deal, but it was better than their other options. The labor contract included shelter, but charged a percentage for everything else, like food consumed, energy use, and any medical care, including preventative.

(I know. Ratthi had said using constructs was slavery but at least I hadn’t had to pay the company for my repair, maintenance, ammo, and armor. Of course, nobody had asked me if I wanted to be a SecUnit, but that’s a whole different metaphor.)

(Note to self: look up definition of metaphor.)

I had asked Ayres if the twenty years was measured by the planetary calendar or the proprietary calendar of the corporation who maintained the planet, or the Corporation Rim Recommended Standard, or what? He didn’t know, and hadn’t understood why it mattered.

Yeah, that was why I was trying not to get attached to any of them.

I would never have picked this transport if I had a choice, but it had been the only one going to the transit station that was the connection to my next destination. I was trying to get to a place called Milu, outside the Corporation Rim.

I had made the decision after I left RaviHyral. At first, I had needed to move fast and put as much distance between myself and its transit station as possible. (See above, murdered humans.) I’d grabbed the first friendly cargo transport and after a seven-cycle trip I disembarked on a crowded transit hub, which was good, because crowds were easy to get lost in, and bad, because there were humans and augmented humans everywhere, all around me, looking at me, which was hell. (After meeting Ayres and the others, obviously my definition of hell changed.)

Also, I missed ART, and I even missed Tapan, and Maro and Rami. If you had to take care of humans, it was better to take care of small soft ones who were nice to you and thought you were great because you kept preventing them from being murdered. (They had only liked me because they thought I was an augmented human, but you can’t have everything.)

After RaviHyral, I’d decided to stop screwing around and get out of the Corporation Rim, but I still had to plan my route. The schedules and feeds I needed hadn’t been accessible on the transport, but now that we’d docked I was inundated with info, so I had to take some time to go through it all. Plus I had been at this hub for twenty-two minutes and I already desperately needed some quiet time. So I ducked into an automated transient service center and used some of the funds on my new hard currency card to pay for a private rest cubicle. It was just big enough to lay down in with my knapsack, but it was enough like a transport box to be vaguely comforting. I had spent a lot of great alone time in transport boxes, being shipped as freight to contracts. I thought a human had to be pretty tired to rest in here without screaming.

Once I was settled, I checked the station feeds for recently arrived newsbursts about DeltFall and GrayCris. I hit a story thread almost immediately. Lawsuits were underway, depositions in progress, and so on. It didn’t look like there had been much change since I left RaviHyral, which was frustrating. That pesky SecUnit nobody wanted to talk about was still unaccounted for, so yay for that. It was hard to tell if the journalists thought somebody was hiding me or not. They didn’t seem to want to speculate that I’d wandered off on my own. Then I hit an interview with Dr. Mensah, posted six cycles ago.

It was unexpectedly good to see her again. I increased magnification for a better look and decided she seemed tired. I couldn’t tell where she was from the video background and a quick scan of the interview content didn’t mention it. I hoped she was back on Preservation; if she was still on Port FreeCommerce I hoped they had contracted decent security. But knowing how she felt about SecUnits (the whole “it’s slavery” thing) I doubted she had. Even without a MedSystem on my feed, I could tell there were changes in the skin around her eyes that indicated a lack of sleep verging on chronic.

I felt a little guilty, sort of, almost. Something was wrong, and I hoped it wasn’t about me. It wasn’t her fault I’d escaped, and I hoped they weren’t trying to hold her responsible for, you know, releasing a rogue SecUnit with a record of past mass murder onto an unsuspecting population. Granted, that hadn’t been her intention. She had meant to ship me home to Preservation, where she would have, I don’t know, civilized me, or educated me, or something. I was vague on the details. The only thing I knew for certain was that Preservation didn’t need SecUnits, and their idea of a SecUnit being considered a free agent meant I’d have a human “guardian.” (In other places they just call that your owner.)

I reviewed the content again. The investigation of GrayCris being conducted by the news agencies was turning up other incidents that suggested the attack on DeltFall was more business as usual for them than an aberration. (This is my surprised face.) GrayCris had been collecting complaints for a long time about sketchy contracts and exclusive-use deals on various sites, including a potential terraforming project outside the Corporation Rim that had been abandoned, though nobody knew why. Fucking up a planet, even part of a planet, for no reason was kind of a big deal, and I was surprised they had gotten away with it. Okay, no, I wasn’t surprised.

The journalist asked Dr. Mensah about that last one, and she said, “After what I saw of GrayCris, I intend to urge the Preservation Council to join the formal call to investigate the situation at Milu. A failed terraforming attempt is a tragic waste of both resources and the natural surface of a planet, but GrayCris has refused to explain their actions.”

The journalist had tagged an infobar to Mensah’s statement, with some commentary about a small company from outside the Corporation Rim which had recently filed to take possession of GrayCris’ abandoned terraform project. They had just set up an automated tractor array to prevent the derelict terraform facility from breaking up in the atmosphere, and were supposed to start assessments soon. The commentary got all dramatic then, wondering what the assessment team would find.

I laid there, flicking through feeds and schedules, and decided I thought I knew what the assessment team would find.

The reason I was wandering free and Dr. Mensah was on the news was because GrayCris had been willing to kill a whole bunch of helpless human researchers for exclusive access to alien remnants, the mineral and possibly biological remains of a sentient alien civilization left in the soil of our survey area. I knew a lot more about it now, after listening to Tapan and the others talk about their code for identifying strange synthetics, and because I’d downloaded a book on it and read it between episodes of my shows. There were tons of agreements between political and corporate entities, inside and outside the Corporation Rim, dealing with alien remnants. Basically you weren’t supposed to touch them without a lot of special certifications and maybe not even then.

When I had left Port FreeCommerce, the assumption was that GrayCris had wanted unimpeded access to those remnants. Presumably, GrayCris would have set up a mining operation or colony build or some other kind of massive project as cover while they recovered and studied the remnants.

So what if the terraform facility at Milu was just a successful cover for a mining or recovery operation for alien remnants or strange synthetics or both? GrayCris had finished the recovery and pretended to abandon the terraform that had never actually been in progress. With the facility derelict, it would eventually break up in the atmosphere, taking all the evidence with it.

If Dr. Mensah had proof of that, the investigation against GrayCris would get a lot more interesting. Maybe so interesting that the journalists would forget all about that stray SecUnit. And then Dr. Mensah wouldn’t be needed on Port FreeCommerce and she could go back to Preservation where it was safe and I could stop worrying about her.

Getting proof wouldn’t be hard, I thought. Humans always think they’ve covered their tracks and deleted their data, but they’re wrong a lot. So … maybe I should do that. I could go to Milu and take whatever data I collected and send it to Dr. Mensah, either to wherever she was staying at Port FreeCommerce or to her home on Preservation. 

I picked up the hub feed again and changed my queries to search for transports to Milu, but there was nothing on the public schedule for this transit station. I widened my search, checking other connected transit stations. All I could find was an old transportation advisory, tagged forty cycles ago, when the news said the terraform facility had been declared abandoned after the local transit station had registered a lengthy period of inactivity. It said the cargo routes to Milu were discontinued, all except for the route originating at HaveRatton Station, which was on the edge of the Corporation Rim. I couldn’t get any updated information about transports going to Milu from HaveRatton, except some vague reports that some had still been in operation at some point.

I might not be able to get to Milu without my own ship, and that wasn’t going to happen. I have a training module for hoppers and other planetary aircraft, but not shuttles or transports or anything. I’d have to steal a ship and a bot pilot, and that would just be getting too complicated, even for me.

But HaveRatton was a main hub for transports heading outside the Corporation Rim and I could choose hundreds of destinations from there. So even if the Milu plan turned out to be a bust, it wouldn’t be a wasted trip.

The next transport leaving directly for HaveRatton was listed as cargo and passenger, and that’s how I ended up with Ayres and his bunch of contract-labor-bound idiots.

After breaking up the latest fight in the mess, and trying to end my short-lived career as a relationship counselor for desperate humans, I went to hide in my bunkspace. When we came through the wormhole and started to approach HaveRatton, I picked up the station feed.

I needed to get the schedules as soon as possible, and I was also looking forward to a chance to download new media. The latest new show I was watching had started out good but turned annoying. It was about a pre-terraform survey (on a planet with completely the wrong profile for terraforming anyway, but I didn’t care about that part) that turned into a battle for survival against hostile fauna and mutant raiders. But the humans were too helpless to make it interesting and they were all getting killed. I could tell it was headed toward a depressing ending, and I just wasn’t in the mood. It was especially annoying because I could see how the addition of a heroic SecUnit and maybe some interesting alien remnants could have turned it into a great adventure story.

And there was no way their bond company would have guaranteed the survey without some kind of professional security. That was unrealistic. Heroic SecUnits were unrealistic, too, but like I had told ART, there’s the right kind of unrealistic and the wrong kind of unrealistic.

I had stopped watching it when the mutants dragged off the group’s biologist to eat him. Seriously, this was exactly the kind of situation I was designed to prevent.

Thinking about the probable fate of Transport’s passengers put me out of the mood, too. I didn’t want to see helpless humans. I’d rather see smart ones rescuing each other.

I sorted through indices of available info, then started new downloads and queried the schedules and transport guide for ways to get to Milu.

Nothing this cycle, nothing the next. Even when I widened the search to thirty cycles from now. Well, that was possibly a problem.

I had been thinking about my plan a lot in between bouts of passenger-wrangling, and now I hated to give it up; I really wanted to hurt GrayCris, and if I couldn’t do it with explosive projectiles, this was the next best way. Maybe the schedules hadn’t been updated; humans are so fucking unreliable when it comes to maintaining data. As we slowed for final approach and docking, I searched the station’s public destination catalog, and yeah, Milu was listed. As usual, an independent company operated the transit station, so it was listed as still active even after the facility had been abandoned. The population of the station was floating and under one hundred at most.

Floating was good as it meant there were few permanent residents; people came and went constantly. But under a hundred was bad. Even if I could get there, with no legitimate reason to be there, I’d have to make sure no one saw me.

ART had altered my configuration so scans wouldn’t read me as a SecUnit, and I had written myself some code to make sure I behaved more like a human or augmented human. (Mostly randomizing my movements and breathing.) But I had to avoid other SecUnits, and it was best to avoid humans (like deployment center personnel) who had seen SecUnits without armor. GrayCris contracted for SecUnits in the Corporation Rim, and they might have used them on the Milu station, too. GrayCris was supposed to have removed any offices from the transit station when they abandoned the facility, but the humans who were still there might have seen their SecUnits. It was a calculated risk, which meant I was doing it even though I knew it could be like shooting myself in the knee joint.

I could have given up on the whole idea. There were transports leaving for destinations far away from Corporate territory, destinations I didn’t know anything about. But I was tired of pretending to be human. I needed a break.

I tried the schedule for privately owned ships and didn’t see any marked for Milu. But there were several ships scheduled to leave in the next cycle or so with no listed destination. One was a small bot-piloted cargo ship that was just large enough to carry supplies for about one hundred to one hundred-fifty humans for one hundred-plus cycles. I checked its history in the knowledge base and saw that it left and returned on a regular schedule. It could be a private contractor supplying Milu station, and not listed on the schedule because they didn’t want any random humans trying to go there until the terraforming facility debacle had been sorted out.

The cargo ship had actually been scheduled to leave eighteen cycles ago, but had requested a hold. Six transports of varying sizes and points of origin were arriving on HaveRatton at the same time as my transport. The supply ship might have been waiting for one of those, if it was fulfilling specific cargo orders. It might have been waiting for a repair.

To find out more, I’d have to ask in person.

Once Transport completed docking protocols, I climbed out of my bunk, collected my knapsack (I had a few things in it but mostly it was just so I could look more like a human traveler), and took a shortcut down the maintenance shaft to the passenger lock. The others would be going out through the cargo lock, into a transport module that a cargo lifter would tow to the ship taking them to their new home. This was billed as for their convenience, but their contractor wouldn’t want them to walk through the station where they might change their minds and escape.

I didn’t want to say goodbye. I couldn’t save this many humans from where they were going, where they thought they wanted to go, but I didn’t have to watch it, either.

I did say goodbye to Transport, which let me out of the lock and then deleted the record from its log. I could tell it was sad to see me go, but this wasn’t a trip I’d be anxious to repeat.

I had practice at hacking different hub and ring security now, so it was much less nerve-racking to get past the weapon scans. SecUnits are designed to be mobile components of SecSystems, every kind of SecSystem, so the company can rent us to as many different clients as possible, even those with proprietary equipment. The trick to hacking a SecSystem is making it think you’re supposed to be there, and the company had helpfully provided us with all the code necessary for that. Practice and terrifying necessity had made me good at altering it on the fly. 

I did stop in the ring mall, at an automated kiosk that sold feed interfaces for non-augmented humans, portable display surfaces, and memory clips. The clips were for extra data storage, and were each about the size of a fingertip. They were used by humans who had to set up new systems or travel to places that didn’t have the feed, or who wanted to store data somewhere that wasn’t feed accessible. (Though company SecSystems had ways of reading them; clients sometimes tried to hide proprietary data on them.) I bought a set of clips with my hard currency card. (I saw it still had plenty of money left on it; Tapan and the others must have paid me a lot.)

The private docks were never as busy as the public ones, with just a few humans heading in or out, and lots of hauler bots moving cargo. I scanned for drones as I crossed the embarkation floor, but there were only two there to monitor hauler bot activity. I found the supply ship’s lock and pinged it to see if anyone was home. The bot pilot pinged back.

It was a lower-level bot, not high functioning enough to be bored while in dock or interested in the prospect of something to do. Like the transport bots I’d run into (ART was the exception) it communicated in images. Yes, it was a supply ship. Yes, it was going to Milu, it went to Milu on a forty-seven-cycle schedule. An update had come from transit control that it was to hold its departure, but it expected clearance sometime in the next two cycles. It was like talking to a recorded travelers’ information ad.

But I figured I’d gotten lucky for once.

I made it think I had Port Authority authorization and asked it to let me board, and it did. Then I gently excised my entrance from its memory. As far as it was concerned, I had always been onboard. I didn’t like to do it; I like to negotiate with bot pilots. But this one was so limited, I was afraid it was incapable of making a deal and sticking to it. I didn’t want to risk it telling the Port Authority about me because it didn’t understand why that was a bad idea.

I went down a short corridor into the main compartment and found the passage into the cargo and supply storage. It was small, just big enough for a console used to attach and remove the two cargo modules, and the lockers for onboard supplies. Both modules were already attached, so if the ship were waiting for cargo, one would have to be detached and reloaded. With the configuration of the crew area, that shouldn’t affect me, though.

I used the time to search around, mostly because I was a little edgy and it’s still programmed habit to patrol. Ship’s repair drones followed me, attracted by a moving body where there wasn’t supposed to be one, but without direction from Ship they didn’t bother me. There were no private cabins, just a couple of bunks built against the bulkheads up on the control deck next to the pilot suite, and two more in cubbies behind the cargo station, next to the emergency MedSystem and a tiny restroom cubby. I didn’t need it, and it would be a relief not to have to pretend to use it often enough to look human. Though I was getting used to having access to a human shower. Compared to a company security ready room, the accommodations were lavish. I settled on one of the bunks on the control deck and started sorting my new media.

(Okay, I should have realized that the pacs of bedding and other supplies in one of the lockers were probably there for a reason.)

After trying and rejecting a few newly downloaded shows, I started on a first episode that looked promising. It took place in an alt-world with magic and improbable talking weapons. (Improbable because I was a talking weapon and I knew how people felt about me.)

Some twenty or so hours later, I was still deep in the show, and enjoying my human-free vacation. Fortunately, when the life support cycled on, I felt the air pressure increase. (I don’t need much air, and can always go into hibernation mode if I run out, so the minimal atmosphere on automated transports is fine for me.)

I paused the show and sat up. I queried the bot pilot and asked if anyone was coming aboard. Yes, the two passengers were coming aboard, and it had received an update from transit authority that it was now cleared to file for a departure time.

Another one of those “oh shit” moments.

I’d searched the ship already, at least, so I had a couple of likely spots in mind. I rolled off the bunk, remembered to grab my bag, dropped down the vertical passage to the main compartment. I crossed the compartment and went down the passage to the cargo area. I picked the locker that was the least accessible, and shifted the contents around until I could squeeze myself into the back, the supply pacs screening me from view. I cozied up to the bot pilot and reminded it I was supposed to be here and there was no need to mention me to anybody else, including its passengers and the Port Authority. It didn’t have any security cameras (transports not controlled by corporate political entities rarely do) but it did have the drones. With their scanners, I had a good view of all the interior compartments, once I filtered out the maintenance data I didn’t need.

Sixteen minutes later, the lock cycled and two passengers came aboard. Two augmented humans, carrying traveling packs and a couple of cases I recognized immediately. Combat gear, including armor and weapons.

Huh. Bots were more common for combat than humans for the same reason SecUnits were more common for security contracts: if we don’t follow orders, we get our brains fried. But there were joint corporate and other political entity treaties about the use of combat bots. (Though everybody seemed to find ways around that. It was a pretty common plot on some of the serials from outside the Corporation Rim.)

I listened in with the drones and Ship’s feed, but the two humans didn’t talk much, just stowing their gear with occasional remarks to each other. From their feed signatures, I knew their names were Wilken and Gerth. It was too much to expect that they would chat about why they were going to Milu, but there were ways.

As a SecUnit, a large part of my function was helping the company record everything my clients did and said so the company could data mine it and sell anything worthwhile. (They say good security comes at a price and the company takes that literally.) Most of the recordings are just junk that gets deleted, but it has to be analyzed first and the good bits pulled out. Normally this is done in conjunction with a SecSystem, but I can do it alone and I still have all the code for it. It was taking up space in my storage that could have been used for media, but it was also something I couldn’t replace on the fly.

While the two humans pulled some supply pacs from the locker I wasn’t in and got settled, I adjusted the drones’ code to let them record. Once I collected enough data, I could start the analysis in background.

As Ship disengaged from the lock and started its trip to Milu, I was already watching my new show again.

It took twenty cycles by Ship’s local time to get to Milu.

I hadn’t expected it to bother me. I’ve been in transport boxes and cubicles for much longer, and a lot of those trips were before I hacked my governor module and started downloading media. But I wasn’t used to traveling as cargo anymore, even with new shows, serials, and several hundred books to go through. The transient rest tube hadn’t bothered me, and I had spent three other transport trips, including the one with ART, mostly without moving. I wasn’t sure what the difference was. Okay, maybe I was sure: in all the other spaces, I’d had the ability to move whenever I wanted.

Whatever, it was a relief when Ship reported that it was on approach to Milu. Two minutes later I realized I was picking up the station feed, but there was nothing on it. Usually there’s traffic and docking information, potential navigation hazards, travelers’ news, that kind of thing, but here there was nothing. I checked with Ship, who reported that there was no other traffic on approach, but this matched with its previous experiences docking at this station. (I had watched a serial once that featured a dead haunted station and okay, that was unlikely, but it’s better to make sure.) 

The silence was still weirdly unnerving. The station was triangle-shaped and smaller than RaviHyral. The scan showed two ships in dock and a scatter of shuttles, a fraction of its capacity.

Ship had moved into docking position before I finally heard anything on the feed. The welcome message sounded normal enough, but the station index looked like the info system had glitched. There was a list of businesses and services, but each entry had been updated with a closed/inactive notice. So the place might not be haunted, but it was teetering on the edge of dead/inactive status.

While I waited for Ship to finish docking, I checked the results of my analysis. Wilken and Gerth were security consultants, hired by a fact-finding research group contracted by GoodNightLander Independent. GI had filed the abandonment markers on GrayCris’ deserted terraforming facility, and set up the tractor array to protect it from disintegration, and now they were starting the process to take formal possession. The research group’s job was to go into the facility and to make a report on its status.

This was exactly the kind of contract that bond companies supply SecUnits for, the kind of contract I had done more times than I still had in my memory. But from Wilken and Gerth’s conversations over the past twenty cycles, it was clear there was no bond company, no SecUnits. I tried not to take it personally.

(If a bond company with SecUnit security had been involved, I would have had to abort this … whatever it was I was doing. The change in my configuration would fool scans but not another SecUnit, and any Unit that detected me would report it to their HubSystem immediately. I sure as hell would have reported me. Rogue SecUnits are fucking dangerous, trust me on that.)

While I was waiting for Ship to finish its docking procedure, I figured the clanking of the docking process would mask any noise from small movements. I pulled my knapsack around, opened the skin of my right arm where it met the edge of my energy weapon, and inserted all the memory clips I’d bought into the space. They felt weird and bulky, but I’d get used to it. I was going to leave my knapsack here in the locker.

We docked, and Wilken and Gerth gathered their gear and went out the airlock into the station. As I unpacked myself from the locker, I used the station’s public feed to hack its security system. Most of the cameras weren’t active, and the scans were checking exclusively for environmental safety and damage detection. They were more worried about their equipment failing than people attempting theft or sabotage, but maybe that was because there weren’t that many people.

Once I’d repacked the locker and made sure I hadn’t left any traces of my presence, I poked around a little to see if the humans had left anything behind. No luck. I hesitated, considering Ship’s drones. With not many cameras to rely on, drones would be nice. But the repair drones were much larger than the ones I was used to working with, mostly to accommodate the little arms and hands they needed for maintenance. I decided depriving Ship of any of them wasn’t worth it.

I did make a few other adjustments. I had Ship note itself in the port’s schedule as under maintenance and made it think it needed my authorization to leave. Since Ship took care of itself and the company that owned it didn’t even have so much as a kiosk in this system, I didn’t think anybody would bother to check on it as long as it didn’t outstay its schedule by more than a few cycles. With so few ships in dock, I didn’t want to get stuck here.

When I cycled through Ship’s lock, the embarkation area was empty. A lack of adequate lighting created lots of shadows, which didn’t disguise the scuff marks and stains on the big floor panels. A lone food wrapper drifted along in the breeze from the air recirc, like they weren’t even running the cleaners anymore. There were no drones, no hauler bots. There were two big bot-piloted lifters outside now removing Ship’s cargo modules for transfer, and I was glad to be able to hear them banging around out there and sending each other data over the station’s mostly silent feed. I don’t like having to navigate halls crowded with humans staring at me and making eye contact, but the opposite was oddly just as creepy.

I found Gerth and Wilken on one of the few working security cameras and started after them. They were heading down the embarkation hall, not up to the habitation levels. There was no tourist map info in the feed, but hacking the cameras gave me access to the station’s maintenance system and I pulled a schematic from there. All the areas except for what was essential for minimum station operation were shut down. I wondered if GoodNightLander Independent’s petition for reclamation from abandonment was popular up here on the transit station. I already didn’t like this place much and I didn’t have to live here.

I have code for freezing cameras and deleting myself from them that I’ve used under much more difficult circumstances, and I altered it to work with the station’s proprietary security system. Though really, the biggest danger was a human spotting me from down the terminal and thinking, Hey, who’s that? Fortunately the station was mostly dark.

I trailed Wilken and Gerth to the end of the embarkation hall and up the ramp toward what the schematic said was the Port Authority/Cargo Control offices.

As I passed the lock junction at the top of the ramp something bright and colorful popped up right in front of me and I nearly screamed. It was an ad for a cargo service, created by marker paint on the floor that reacted to movement. It threw a little video into the feed, too, just in case you somehow missed the glowing thing in your face. Usually these markers are only used for emergency procedures because they work even if the power is down. I had never seen them used for ads before. The whole point of markers was that they were the only thing visible in a power outage so it would be easy to see them. It was hard enough trying to get stupid humans to follow the markers to safety without ads popping up obscuring the emergency route—

I reminded myself it wasn’t my job to get humans to safety anymore.

I still hated the marker ads.

I checked the cameras again and saw Wilken and Gerth had found signs of life in the Port Authority area. They stood outside an office center with three levels of bubble windows looking out over what should be the station mall. It was an open plaza area with a couple of tube transports arcing overhead, and a big globular display that was currently on standby hovering in the air. It was surrounded by multi-levels of dark shadowy occupation blocks and empty fronts for places that should be cafés, hotels, cargo brokers, transit offices, tech shops, and so on. Much of it looked unfinished, like no one had ever moved in, and the rest had closed, nothing left behind but a few stray floating display surfaces.

I turned into a corridor that would have led away from the Port Authority district into the main habitation block, if there had been one. I walked in the near-darkness until I found an empty cubby prepared for something that had never been installed, and crouched down inside it. I could monitor the cameras now without worrying about any random station personnel spotting me. A maintenance/weapons scanner drone brushed my feed, and I grabbed it and got control. It was on a desultory patrol outside the PA offices and I used it to give me better views and audio than the static security camera.

Wilken and Gerth were talking to two new humans. There was also a human-form bot standing nearby. I hadn’t seen one in a while in person, just on the entertainment feed. They aren’t popular in corporation territory, because there’s not a lot of things they can do that task-specific bots can’t do better, and with the feed available their data storage and processing ability isn’t that exciting. Unlike constructs, they don’t have any cloned human tissue, so they’re just a bare metal bot-body that can pick up heavy things, except not as well as a hauler bot or any other kind of cargo lifter. 

In some entertainment media I had seen, they were used to portray the evil rogue SecUnits who menaced the main characters. Not that I was annoyed by that or anything. It was actually good, because then humans who had never worked with SecUnits expected us to look like human-form bots, and not what we actually looked like. I wasn’t annoyed at all. Not one bit.

I had to run back the drone’s camera feed to catch up, I had been so busy conquering that burst of non-annoyance. The first new human said, “I’m Don Abene.” She gestured to the other new human. “This is my colleague Hirune, and our assistant Miki.” She hesitated. “Did the employment agent have time to brief you?”

“They said it was a bodyguard job.” Wilken flicked a glance at the bot, which was apparently called Miki. It stood there with its head cocked, staring at her with big globe-like eyes. It was unusual for a human to introduce a bot, and that’s putting it mildly. Gerth looked like she was struggling to keep her expression professionally blank. Wilken continued, “You’re going down to the terraforming facility to make an initial assessment and your contract with GoodNightLander Independent requires a security team.”

Abene nodded. “I’m hoping we won’t actually need you. But the company that abandoned the facility didn’t maintain the satellite monitoring, and no one has been inside since they left. We assume it’s deserted, but there’s no way to make sure.”

“The agent said that was a potential problem,” Gerth said. “The terraforming shield is preventing any off-site scanning?”

Hirune answered, “Yes. We know it’s stable, because of the tractor array GI put into place, but that’s all. The station’s been monitoring the facility, but as you can see, there are no patrol vessels here.”

She meant there was a possibility that raiders had moved into the facility. Except if they did that, they couldn’t have been very good raiders, because they had ignored this station. Also, raiders tend to hit and run, and not hang around to live on a deteriorating terraforming facility.

Actually, with my experience in security, anybody who wanted to hang around and live on a deteriorating terraforming facility worried me a lot more than raiders.

Gerth and Wilken exchanged a look. Maybe the same thought had occurred to them. Wilken asked, “Is there a possibility there were active organisms in the facility when it was abandoned?”

“The biological matrices would have been sealed, and probably destroyed, before the staff left,” Hirune said. She made a gesture, like flicking something away. “Even if they hadn’t, there’s very little chance that they could create any dangerous airborne contamination.”

Wilken’s expression remained professionally cool, but she persisted, “I meant something other than bacteria. Any organisms large enough to be a physical danger?”

Right, so even I knew more about terraforming than these two.

Hirune’s face now had the blank, lip-biting expression I associated with humans trying not to show their feelings, especially the feeling that someone had said something unintentionally hilarious. (This is why it had been a struggle for me to give up armor; concealing facial expressions was hard, even for humans.)

Don Abene’s eyes crinkled, but she made it seem more like she and Wilken were sharing a joke. “The matrix wouldn’t be working with any organisms larger than bacteria. And there wouldn’t really be any reason to bring any larger organisms up from the surface to the facility. Of course, we don’t know that they didn’t. So it’s proper to exercise caution.”

Wilken seemed to accept that, or at least didn’t ask any more questions. It sort of made sense. It was a security consultant’s job to be skeptical of their clients’ assurances that everything was fine. (SecUnit clients, at least, only assured each other that everything was fine while you stared at the wall and waited for everything to go horribly wrong.)

Abene and Hirune walked the security consultants into the Port Authority now, where they had quarters with the skeleton station team. They were talking about a full briefing, team prep, and a departure time sixteen hours from now. Miki the human-form bot followed, then stopped. It turned, and looked up at the drone I was riding. Its head cocked and I could tell it was focusing in on the camera.

I let the drone go, its memory of the temporary takeover blanked. It sent a confused reorientation request to the PA’s system, then wandered off back to its patrol route.

Miki didn’t move, still staring into the dark with the opaque surface of its eyes. The feed was clear, it couldn’t know I was here.

Then Miki sent a directionless ping. Just a call into the dark, checking to see if there was anyone out there who wanted to reply.

I checked myself for signal leakage, tightened my walls, and reminded myself to be careful. Just because the station feed was silent didn’t mean no one was listening. The GI expedition would be running their feed off the systems equipment they brought with them, but someone on the station staff was giving the lifter bots orders and maybe still checking the security reports.

This place was so quiet, maybe Miki had picked up the marker ad I’d tripped. Maybe it had heard a whisper in the otherwise empty feed, and that was creepy enough it even bothered me. Finally, it turned and followed its owner into the PA complex.

I slipped out of the cubby and went down the dark hall to find a better hiding place.

I worked my way around through the maintenance passages and loading corridors, into an empty commercial slot not far from the Port Authority. After some careful work, I managed to get a view from the two security cameras inside the PA offices. Yes, two. It was weird to be around humans who didn’t monitor everything everybody did constantly via Sec- or HubSystems or drones, and who relied on human supervisors. And one camera was in the central hub for the port traffic control and the other in a jury-rigged hub that was now acting as station control—the two places where if something went wrong, you needed to know right away; in other words, not the mess, restrooms, or private quarters. It was almost like nobody here cared what anybody said or did as long as they weren’t trying to blow up the station or crash the lifter-bots. (After thousands of hours spent analyzing and deleting video of humans eating, having sex, performing hygiene, and eliminating excess bodily fluids, it was a relief, but still.)

Fortunately the GI expedition and the station staff seemed to be pretty casual with each other and I was able to catch enough conversation to hear that the first assessment would be a short one, just twelve hours on the facility for an initial estimate of its condition, then they would return to the station to analyze their findings, take a rest period, then head back. That sounded perfect. Twelve hours should be plenty of time for me to find what I needed.

I also heard what docking slot their ship was leaving from and when they were loading supplies aboard. I still needed help getting onto the expedition ship. But with none to few active systems to work through, I didn’t have much choice.

I was going to have to make friends with the stupid pet robot.

Hi, Miki.

It answered immediately, Hi! Who are you?

I was using the address in the ping Miki had sent to establish a secure connection. Abene and the others had finished their prep and were taking a rest period before leaving for the terraforming facility. It gave me about three hours to seduce the robot. I didn’t expect it to take that long. 

I said, I’m a security consultant. GoodNightLander Independent contracted with my security company to make sure your team completes their mission safely. It tried to message Abene over the feed, and I blocked it. You can’t tell anyone I’m here. I expected it to ask me how I had managed to take over its feed, how I had gotten onto the station. I thought I’d managed to anticipate most of the questions and had my answers ready.

It said, But why not? I tell Don Abene everything. She’s my friend.

When I’d called it a pet robot, I honestly thought I was exaggerating. This was going to be even more annoying than I had anticipated, and I had anticipated a pretty high level of annoyance, maybe as high as 85 percent. Now I was looking at 90 percent, possibly 95 percent.

I managed to keep my reaction out of the feed. It wasn’t easy. I said, This has to be a secret, to keep Don Abene and the others safe. We can’t risk anyone finding out about it.

Okay, it said. I wasn’t sure if it was serious. It couldn’t be this easy. Maybe it was just going along until it had a chance to report me? But it said, Promise me Don Abene and all my friends will be safe.

I had the horrible feeling it was serious. I hadn’t expected a bot on ART’s level, but holy shit. Had the humans actually coded it to be childlike, or petlike, I guess? Or had its code developed that way on its own, responding to the way they treated it?

I hesitated, because while I would rather not see a group of humans killed (again), I wasn’t their SecUnit, or even their pretend augmented human security consultant. It’s hard to keep humans safe when you can’t let them see you. But it was waiting, and I wanted it to trust me, and I said, I promise.

Okay. What’s your name?

This caught me off guard. Bots don’t have names, SecUnits don’t have names. (I’d given myself a name, but it was private.) I used the name I’d given Ayres and the others, my poor dumb humans who had sold themselves to a company and by now probably understood just how bad a deal it was. Rin. Security Consultant Rin.

That’s not your real name. I could tell through the feed it was genuinely confused. It doesn’t sound like you.

Obviously Miki was getting more through the feed than I had assumed. That was all I needed. I had nothing prepared for this, and there sure as hell wasn’t anything in my buffer that was remotely helpful. I defaulted to honesty (I know, I was surprised, too) and said, Rin is what I want to be called. I don’t tell anyone my real name.

Okay. I understand, Rin. I won’t tell anyone that you’re here. I will be your friend and help Don Abene and our team.

Right. (I almost said, Okay.) I couldn’t tell if that was a default answer or Miki was making me a solemn promise. Whatever, either it told the humans about me or it didn’t, and if I was going to do this I had to assume it wouldn’t. Can you give me system access to your shuttle? I want to make sure it’s safe.

Okay. And the data came through the feed.

What they were calling a shuttle was actually a local space exploration/transit vehicle, with two levels of crew habitation areas plus a cargo hold that had been converted to bio lab space. It didn’t have the drive to get through the wormhole, but it could go anyplace else around the system. No bot pilot, just the kind of minimal automatic pilot system that I was more used to seeing on atmospheric craft. Not that helpful if everyone capable of operating the ship’s higher-level functions were injured or incapacitated. On the other hand, you couldn’t deliver killware if there was no bot pilot to kill.

The shuttle had no independent SecSystem, either. I had seen on some media from outside the Corporation Rim that internal security was less of an issue there, that the focus was on potential external threats more than it was on policing your own people. I hadn’t thought it was true, but it did mesh in with the lack of interest in monitoring the station staff in their private quarters. Also with the way my PreservationAux clients had behaved. It made me wonder what Preservation might be like, but I squelched that thought. It was probably a boring place where everybody would stare at SecUnits, just like everywhere else.

Miki was giving me full access, so I took a little tour via its memory of previous trips. It was a nice shuttle, way nicer than anything the company would have provided; even the upholstery was clean and repaired. It was another sign of GI’s commitment to their reclamation project; it would have come here in a big transport’s belly cargo module, or in tow via a dedicated supply hauler like Ship.

I would need to ride Miki’s internal feed the way ART had ridden mine, though unlike ART I couldn’t do it over the distance between a station and a planet. The good part was that there were plenty of places to hide onboard the shuttle, even without packing myself in a cabinet. The bad part was that I would have no systems to see through, no eyes and ears except for Miki.

Yeah, I was thrilled.

Miki, I’m going to need to use your systems to monitor your— I almost said clients. It took almost a full second for me to be able to use the word Miki wanted to hear. —your friends. I need you to be my camera, and let me use your scanning ability. Sometimes I might need to speak through you, pretending to be you, to warn Don Abene and your friends about things I believe are dangerous. Can you let me do that?

Obviously, with the access Miki had given me already, I could have taken Miki over, done what I wanted, and excised it all from its memory. I had done it to Ship, but Ship was a low-level bot and didn’t have enough self-awareness to give a shit. Doing that to Miki … But I didn’t know what I would do if it said no.

Miki said, Okay, I will do that, Consultant Rin. That sounds scary, but I want to make sure no one hurts my friends.

This felt way too easy. I almost suspected a trap. Or … Miki, have you been directed to reply to every query with a yes?

No, Consultant Rin, Miki said, and added, amusement sigil 376 = smile.

Or Miki was a bot who had never been abused or lied to or treated with anything but indulgent kindness. It really thought its humans were its friends, because that’s how they treated it.

I signaled Miki I would be withdrawing for one minute. I needed to have an emotion in private.

I used the station's hauler-bot delivery passage to get through the derelict mall and back down to the embarkation zone. The shuttle was docked in the Port Authority area and fortunately there was a working security camera. I was able to get a view of the area and see when it was clear. From Miki’s feed I knew that two crew members were up on the control deck running a pre-flight check and the others were still in their station lab space doing their last check list.

I froze the camera’s feed just long enough to sprint across the shadowy embarkation zone and reach the lock. I submitted the entry code Miki had supplied. The lock cycled open, letting out a breath of recycled air that my scan said was much cleaner than what was on the station. It sure smelled better. I stepped inside, closed the lock, and deleted my entry from the log.

I was listening in on Miki’s feed connection with the human assessment team. I heard Kader, one of the two augmented human pilots up on the shuttle’s flight deck, say, Hirune, is that you?

Hirune replied, What? I’m still in the PA. We’re about to come down.

Oddness, I thought I heard the hatch open.

An entry’s not in the log, the other pilot, Vibol, added. I think your ears are confused. 

Now I have to check it out to prove you wrong, Kader told her.

I was already down the passage to the work space, past the bio labs to the supply storage. There was a slot for an onboard hauler bot, but since the cargo space had been converted to labs, the bot had been offloaded. It was more roomy than the supply locker on Ship, and at least I could sit on the deck and lean against the wall, even if I couldn’t stretch my legs out. I didn’t actually need to stretch, but it was nice. It was also completely dark, but with a lively feed in my head, that wasn’t a problem.

Miki asked, Are you okay, Consultant Rin?

I checked again to make sure our connection was secure, that the humans couldn’t hear it and none of the augmented humans could pick up an echo. It was, because I had control of Miki’s feed, but I’d probably keep checking every time it talked to me because that was just the kind of cycle I was having. I’m fine. You can call me Rin. It was slightly less annoying than “Consultant Rin.” It hadn’t been annoying when Tapan, Rami, and Maro had called me Consultant, but … I don’t know, everything was annoying right now and I had no idea why.

Okay, Rin! Miki said. We’re friends, and friends call each other by name.

Maybe I did know why.

I watched through Miki’s eyes as it helped the expedition bring the last few pieces of their equipment and testing supplies down. They loaded it all through the airlock and stowed it away. I listened to them talk on the feed, and they seemed excited to be finally on their way. There were four researchers and two shuttle crew, all long-term employees of GoodNightLander Independent who had worked together before, who had been waiting impatiently here for their security detail to show up. Don Abene grabbed Miki’s arms at one point and smiled into its camera. I was glad I hadn’t made any attempt to control Miki’s movements, because my recoil was so immediate and instinctive I whacked my head against the wall of my storage space.

(Nobody grabs SecUnits. I hadn’t realized this was a perk until now.)

I’m still not good at telling human ages just by looking. Don Abene’s warm brown skin was lined at the corners of her mouth and eyes, and her long dark hair had strands of white in it, but for all I knew it was a cosmetic choice. She laughed and her dark eyes crinkled. “We’re finally going, Miki!”

“Hurray!” Miki said, and from inside its feed, I could see it was sincere.

Miki helped Hirune stow the protective suits, then defaulted to randomly following its human friends around as they stowed their personal gear. I suggested Miki walk out of the lab space and go to the storage area where Wilken and Gerth were unpacking their equipment. Miki didn’t have a weapons scan nearly as sensitive as mine but its vision had magnification capabilities that mine didn’t. (This is one of the differences between a security unit and a bot designed to help with scientific research.)

I asked it to take a good look at the cases the two security consultants were unpacking and it gave me a close-up view, breaking up the image into different angles as Gerth lifted her case into the storage locker. I’d wanted to do this aboard Ship, but they had stowed their gear too quickly, and asking a drone to inspect it would probably have drawn some unwanted attention. Gerth glanced at Miki, stowed the case, and said, “What are you looking at?”

I told Miki, Say, “Don Abene wants me to ask you if you need any help stowing your gear.”

Miki cocked its head and repeated it verbatim, with the kind of perfect innocence only a perfectly innocent bot could manage.

Gerth smiled a little. “No, thanks, little bot,” she said. Wilken chuckled.

“Little bot,” seriously? (Somewhere there had to be a happy medium between being treated as a terrifying murder machine and being infantilized.) I prompted Miki to go back to its friends. As it retreated down the passage, it asked, Rin, why did they not want us to see their cases?

Not everybody wants a pet robot sticking its scanner into their business, but I was distracted and just said, I’m not sure. From the shapes, the cases held weapons, ammo, and a couple of high-end sets of self-adjusting armor, the kind I’d only seen in the media. The company had never given us armor that nice, though in its defense, our armor did get blasted off us at regular intervals. No drones, but then humans aren’t good with security drones; it takes multi-track processing to direct them and most humans just can’t do it without extensive augmentation. Even without drones, they looked like they were prepared for anything. Maybe no reason.

I was trying to decide if I should take the opportunity to steal anything if said opportunity should occur. The self-adjusting armor was incredibly tempting, and would be even better once I made some modifications to the code. But it was enough work to just get myself past the weapons scanners; bringing anything that bulky along was just going to make it more likely that I’d be caught.

Miki went up to the crew area below the control deck where Abene and Hirune sat with Brais and Ejiro. Kader and Vibol were just above us in the cockpit. The humans had turned a couple of the station chairs around to face the curved padded couch, and were watching the bubble of a floating display surface in the middle of the compartment. From the schematics on display, they were going over a proposed route through the facility. I was poking around carefully in their individual feeds, when Abene patted the seat next to her. “Sit down, Miki.”

Miki sat next to her on the couch, and none of the other humans reacted. This was apparently perfectly normal.

“Are you excited to see the inside of the facility, Miki?” Hirune asked it, as she turned the schematic to a new angle. “I’m tired of just looking at maps of it.”

“I’m excited!” Miki echoed. “We will do a good assessment, and then we can have a new assignment.”

Ejiro laughed. “I hope it’s that easy.”

Brais said, “I don’t care if it’s easy or hard, at least we’re moving! Miki was probably getting tired of playing Mus with us.”

“I like games. I would play games all the time if we could,” Miki said.

I had to withdraw back to my dark cubicle. I was having an emotion again. An angry one.

Before Dr. Mensah bought me, I could count the number of times I sat on a human chair and it was never in front of clients.

I don’t even know why I was reacting this way. Was I jealous of a human-form bot? I didn’t want to be a pet robot, that’s why I’d left Dr. Mensah and the others. (Not that Mensah had said she wanted a pet SecUnit. I don’t think she wanted a SecUnit at all.) What did Miki have that I wanted? I had no idea. I didn’t know what I wanted.

And yes, I know that was probably a big part of the problem right there.

I stepped back into Miki’s feed. Don Abene was saying, “—keep in mind that your experience with humans is limited. We think of you as one of our family, but to others, you are a stranger. That’s probably why our security team didn’t want you to look at their things.”

Uh-oh. I ran back Miki’s camera to pick up the part of the conversation I’d missed. Miki had asked Abene why Gerth had reacted that way when it had looked at her and Wilken’s cases. Fortunately, Abene had gotten distracted trying to answer the question while still looking over the facility’s schematic, and hadn’t asked why Miki had gone to see the security team. If she thought to ask about it, would Miki tell her about me? How would it answer that question? 

I could take Miki over the way I’d originally planned, except its interactions with Abene and the others were incredibly complicated. I didn’t think I could fake my way through that; my augmented human security consultant act had been hard enough to develop, and I wasn’t trying to fool people who knew me. Or who I was pretending to be. Or whatever.

Trying not to sound nervous and/or enraged, I said, Miki, remember you said you wouldn’t tell Don Abene about me.

I won’t, Rin. Miki was so calm and complacent, my performance reliability dropped by 2 percent. I promised.

I managed to seethe silently. But part of Miki’s coded behavior must include going to Don Abene when it had questions. I was going to need to make sure I answered its questions as thoroughly as possible; obviously “I don’t know” wasn’t going to cut it.

Hirune was asking Abene, “What do you think of our security team so far?”

Abene said, “I’m pleased, actually. They don’t seem to know much about terraforming facilities, but that shouldn’t matter.”

It might, I thought. But SecUnit education modules were crap and all I knew about terraforming was what I had managed to absorb while completely not caring about it, so maybe I wasn’t the best authority.

Through Miki’s eyes, I saw Hirune glance at the other two, who were talking about calibrating something. She lowered her voice. “I suppose. With only two of them, they’re not going to be much help against raiders.”

Abene snorted. “If there are raiders, we’re pulling out and heading back for the transit station immediately.”

By the time you see them, it’s too late for that.

My reaction must have gotten into the feed, because Miki asked anxiously, You’ll keep them safe, Rin?

Yes, Miki, I told it, because that was my story and I was sticking to it.

In Miki's feed I had access to a scan of the terraforming facility, superimposed with a schematic from the original specs. Yeah, I think I knew where to look for the evidence I wanted.

Through Miki’s camera I saw the visual approaching on the shuttle’s display. We had passed the tractor array already, still operating at optimal capacity according to the automated reports it was sending to the station.

The facility was a huge platform in the upper atmosphere, far larger than the station, larger than a full-sized transit ring. Most of that space was for the pods that contained the enormous engines that would actually control the terraforming process. There was no visual of the planet itself; the facility hung in a layer of perpetual storm. Swirling, towering clouds, filled with electrical discharges, obscured any view of the surface.

“We’re seeing good levels on all the environmentals,” Kader said from the cockpit, sharing an image of the readings through the feed. “Are you sure you want to go with full gear?”

I tensed, certain it was going to be the wrong answer. Miki, tell her— But Abene replied, “Yes, we’ll go full safety protocol.” That meant full suits, with filtering and emergency air supply, and some protection for vulnerable human bodies. “We’ll keep to that until we can inspect the environmentals and take over facility control, then we’ll reevaluate.”

I relaxed. Then I reminded myself yet again that these weren’t my clients.

Miki said, It’s okay, Rin. Don Abene is always cautious.

I’d seen lots of dead cautious humans, but I wasn’t going to say that to Miki.

Through Miki’s eyes I watched Abene gear up for the first assessment walk-through. Kader and Vibol were staying on the ship, but Wilken and Gerth, plus Hirune and the two other researchers, Brais and Ejiro, were going with Abene and Miki.

Wilken exited the lock first, and her helmet cam sent the video into the feed. We had locked onto a passenger-only dock in the habitation pod and the embarkation area wasn’t big enough to accommodate heavy equipment or standard hauler bots. Power was on but at minimal; emergency light bands glowed at the floor level, halfway up the wall, and at the top, but the larger overheads were off. It was enough light for the humans to see without the special filters in the helmet cameras.

Was it a good idea to board the facility here? The schematic showed a larger multi-use embarkation space on the level above us. This smaller loading zone could make the approach to the shuttle easier to defend, but it could also make it more difficult to get the team back into the shuttle if something went wrong.

It was hard to say if it was a bad judgment or not. There was always the fact that humans are lousy at security. I would have gone in first with a full deployment of drones, leaving the humans on the sealed shuttle. I would have evaluated the facility (i.e., made sure there weren’t any unwanted visitors, by walking around as bait waiting for something to attack me) and only then brought the humans in. But don’t mind me, it’s not like I know what I’m doing or anything.

The camera in Wilken’s armor sent video into the team feed as Wilken moved forward. She went through the lock and into the corridor, and I noted no damage, just a few scuffs and scrapes on walls and floor, signs of normal use. Abene, Hirune, Miki, and then Brais and Ejiro followed, with Gerth bringing up the rear. I split my attention into seven streams, one for each human’s helmet camera plus Miki. I was listening in on the team feed and comm, but that was all coming through Miki, too. Abene said, “Miki, are you picking up anything?”

“No, Don Abene,” Miki said. It was scanning for signal activity from any resident systems. Since this facility had been built by GrayCris, I was expecting the kind of HubSystem and SecSystem I was used to, or something compatible. There were lots of security cameras everywhere, they just weren’t active. Miki was right, there was nothing but dead air in here, no facility feed activity despite the power for lights and environmentals.

Maybe they thought the systems would be lonely if they were left active, Rin, Miki said. What do you think?

I wondered if ART had thought I was this stupid when it had been riding around in my head. Maybe, but the chances were good that if that had been the case, ART would have said so.

That might be true, I said, because I knew now if I didn’t answer all Miki’s questions it might accidentally rat me out to the nearest human. But then I remembered this place had been meant to collapse and burn up in the atmosphere before GI had put in the claim on it. I added, GrayCris might have removed the central cores for the resident systems when they pulled out. They’d want to cut their losses. Sec- and HubSystems that could run a facility this complex would be hugely expensive. I didn’t know about GrayCris, but the company that owned me would never have left that much cash behind.

And Miki said, “Don Abene, maybe GrayCris removed the central cores for the resident systems when they pulled out. They would want to cut their losses.”

For fuck’s sake.

“That makes sense,” Hirune said. She had been poking at her comm, and added, “There’s some interference, maybe shielding? I can’t pick up the station traffic anymore, though I can still hear Kader and Vibol on our shuttle’s feed.”

Ejiro pulled a sample of the signal interference into his feed to study it. “Yes, we know the shielding’s pretty heavy, probably due to the disturbances in the atmosphere.” As if on cue, a burst of signal static blotted out the comm and feed for 1.3 seconds. 

Heavy weather, Vibol commented over the comm. Watch out for rain.

The team chuckled, and Miki sent an amusement sigil into the team feed. Oh, a running joke, those aren’t annoying at all. Wilken and Gerth ignored the byplay.

Ahead, Wilken stepped out of the corridor into a larger space, the scanner on her armor telling her it was empty of life signs. She paced around the circumference, clearing the room, then signaled the others to come in. This space wasn’t labeled on the schematic but had decontam cubicles and environmental suits stored in racks against the walls. Again, no damage visible as the humans flashed their cameras around. Brais said, “Was this a clean facility? I thought the bio pod was separated and sealed. That’s what it said in the schematic, wasn’t it?”

“I’m sure that’s the case,” Hirune said. She checked a panel on the nearest decontam cubicle. It still had power, but the doors were all in the upright position. (Always a relief. Cubicles that something may be hiding in are no fun.) Hirune tried to get it to download a usage report to the feed, but its internal storage was empty.

I checked Kader and Vibol, who were both glued to their feeds, though Kader still had a channel open to station. There was some interference, but he was still getting pings and answers from the station Port Authority. It probably was the atmospheric shielding that was blocking the team inside from contact with the station.

Anyway, it was time to get moving. I slipped out of my storage cubby. I went down the corridor and cycled the lock, not allowing it to report the incident to its log. Kader had heard the lock open on the station when I boarded but this time was too occupied watching the team in the feed to notice.

I stepped out into the cooler facility air and let the lock close and seal.

The team had already moved out of the decontam room and headed toward the bio pod to check its status. I started down the corridor. I’d missed my armor off and on before this, usually when I was having to walk through large crowds of humans in transit rings. After being forced to do it to survive, plus traveling with Ayres and the others, I was sort of used to talking to humans and making eye contact, though I didn’t like it.

This was the first time I missed my armor because I felt a physical threat.

I moved silently through the decontam room and took the exit corridor, then turned down the branch that led away from the bio pod, toward the geo pod. This corridor was the same as what I was seeing on Miki’s camera and the team feed: no damage, no signs of hasty departure, just quiet corridors.

(I don’t know why I expected to see damage and signs that the human staff had run for their lives; there was no indication that this was anything but a planned abandonment. Maybe I was thinking of RaviHyral again. You’d think once I’d seen the place, found out what had happened, the partial memories would fade. Not so much, it turned out.)

It shouldn’t have been weird, but it was weird. I had Miki and the team backburnered, so I knew exactly where they were, and their voices filled the silence in the feed. But there was something about this place that made my human skin prickle under my clothes. I hated that.

I couldn’t pin down what was bothering me. Scan was negative, and this far away from the team there was no ambient sound except the whisper through the air system. Maybe it was the lack of security camera access, but I’d been in worse places with no cameras. Maybe it was something subliminal. Actually, it felt pretty liminal. Pro-liminal. Up-liminal? Whatever, there was no knowledge base here to look it up.

The team was proceeding down an outer corridor. On their left side, big bubble ports looked into a purple-gray cloud swirl in the storm, on the right were open passage locks leading down into the various engineering stacks. On a private channel to Miki, Abene said, This place makes my skin shiver, Miki.

I think so, too, Miki said. Even though it’s empty, it’s like someone might step out in front of us at any moment.

Well, Miki wasn’t wrong. Something glittered in the air ahead, but when I reached the lift junction it was just an emergency marker display, floating below the ceiling and listing emergency exit procedures in thirty different languages. HubSystems offer continuous translation, and I’m guessing non-corporate political entities had something similar for their feeds, but in an emergency you’d want to make sure the instructions were clear even if the feed was down. There it was, cheerily doing its job in this empty hulk.

I tapped my private connection to Miki. I’m about to use a lift, Miki. If your scan picks up the power fluctuation, please don’t tell anyone.

Okay, Rin. Where are you going?

I have to look at the geo pod. It’s part of my orders. The lift responded to a ping and arrived 1.5 seconds later, by which time I remembered that I’d told Miki my job was to provide extra security for the assessment team. Oops.

Fortunately, Miki understood about orders and it didn’t occur to it to question me. Be careful, Rin, Miki said. This place makes our skin shiver.

I stepped into the lift and told it to go to the central geo pod. The door slid shut and it whooshed away. I tracked it on the schematic, as it curved past the giant bulbs used for atmosphere dispersal. I considered telling Miki that I was here to collect data on possible alien remnant violations by GrayCris. Nothing I was doing would hurt Abene or the team or GoodNightLander Independent, and I was already lying about so much. But Miki would tell Abene immediately, I knew it would. Not that her team wouldn’t figure out on their own soon that something was sketchy about the terraforming facility. (Like the decontam room near the passenger lock; you don’t need a clean facility for terraforming but you might if you were scavenging alien bio remnants.) But if Miki told Abene, she would ask how it knew, and I knew Miki would tell her about me. It wouldn’t lie to a direct question.

Who knew being a heartless killing machine would present so many moral dilemmas.

(Yes, that was sarcasm.)

The lift stopped and the doors opened into another empty, quiet corridor. I followed it around and found the big hatchway into the main geological hub. It was a large semicircular space, with a section of ceiling that had been left clear. I’d seen the storm through Miki and the humans’ cameras in the corridor on the way to the bio pod, but seeing it with my own eyes, no interface to interpret it, was different. The clouds were like a constantly moving structure, colors not so much swirling as in slow, ponderous motion. It was immense, and wrong, and terrible and beautiful all at the same time. I stood there for what I later clocked as twenty-two seconds, just staring.

Something must have bled over into the feed, because Miki said, What are you looking at, Rin?

That jolted me out of the spell. Just the storm. The geo pod has a clear dome.

Can I see?

I didn’t know why not, so I made a copy of the visual, scrubbed any code that might identify me as a SecUnit from it, and passed it to Miki over the feed. Pretty! Miki said.

Miki ran the video a few times as it followed Abene down a ramp. They had passed a lift junction, but it wasn’t big enough for all of them at once and Wilken sensibly refused to split the group. On the feed from Wilken’s cam, I spotted hovering marker displays with the descriptor symbols for biological hazard potential; they were nearly there and I needed to get a move on. I wanted to be tucked up back in the shuttle and watching Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon by the time they finished their check of the bio pod. 

The access consoles had been shut down and the data storage would have been removed entirely, which was way more secure than just a system delete. But that wasn’t where I intended to look.

The schematic showed that the facility used diggers. (Actually geological manipulation semiautonomous … something something, apparently I deleted that out of permanent storage. Anyway, they aren’t bots, they’re just extensions of the geo systems.) The diggers have their own onboard storage for their procedures and tasks, but they also have scanning capability and they log what they find. I found and booted their interface console and yes, the diggers were still here, tucked under the geo pod, curled up in containers three times the size of our shuttle, inert without their parent system.

With the interface I was able to make copies of their storage without waking them. Somebody had thought to order them to dump their logs (which would void their warranties, but I guess since the facility was supposed to fall into the planet, nobody had cared). Unfortunately for that somebody, the diggers had dumped their logs into their buffers and then been shut down before the buffers timed out and deleted.

It was a lot of data, but I was able to construct a query to exclude the operation commands and other extraneous stuff. I had to make a direct connection to copy the data to the extra memory clips I’d implanted, which meant peeling back the skin around my right forearm weapon port again. Once I had that done, it went pretty quickly. I sat on the edge of the console, facing the door, and started up a favorite episode of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon in background to help pass the time, though I kept one channel on Miki and the team feed.

I had just finished when Miki said, Rin, is that you?

I was distracted, stopping the episode, untangling myself from the console and from the sleeping, mostly empty brains of the diggers. I knew the team was still over in the hub for the bio pod (they were doing a physical assessment of the equipment for the bio matrices, and trying to get the consoles rebooted), so the question didn’t make sense. Is that me what?

This. Miki sounded confused, worried. It sent me an audio clip. I heard the humans talking on the comms, Hirune and Ejiro, then Gerth made a comment.

The conversation? It was something about containment units not being where they were supposed to be, and I didn’t understand why Miki was confused. I’m still in the geo pod.

No, Rin, this. Miki replayed the clip and stripped out the comms audio, so the human voices were much fainter. It was ambient audio, I could hear the air system. I could also hear light thumps, fast like a heartbeat … Oh, oh shit.

I wasted .002 seconds throwing a code into Miki’s feed like I was responding to another SecUnit. I was at the hatch to the geo hub before I realized I needed to say it, or Miki wouldn’t understand what to do. I slammed around the corner and up the corridor toward the lift junction. Miki, you have an incoming unknown/potential hostile moving toward your position. Determine direction, then alert your clients, in that order.

Miki widened its scan, and the rest of its senses went dark as it shifted all its attention to audio. It was rotating, trying to get a wider field. I was still getting the comms on the humans’ feed, and Gerth said, “What’s the little bot doing?”

“What’s wrong, Miki?” Abene asked.

Rin— Miki stopped trying to sound like a human and sent me an urgent assistance request tied to the raw audio data. I should have realized, Miki wasn’t a security bot, it had no code to deal with this and no one had ever shown it what to do in an emergency involving active and probably sentient hostiles. I reached the lift junction but the stupid lift had returned to a neutral station somewhere.

While I stood there like an idiot during the wasted seconds while the stupid lift returned to this position, I ran a quick analysis and compared it to the facility’s schematic. I put markers up for Miki, the humans, and the incoming hostile, and shoved it back into Miki’s feed. Miki was already saying, “Don Abene, something is coming toward us. We need to take the outer corridor back to the shuttle.” It forwarded my active schematic to the humans.

I stepped into the lift as the doors opened. As I hit the destination sequence, I compared the ambient audio Miki was still processing with the projection on my schematic. This thing, whatever it was, was moving much faster than my first projection had indicated. I sent to Miki, No time to withdraw, tell client to shelter in place and try to lock down area.

Miki was saying to Abene, “Don Abene, it’s too close, we have to stay here and seal the door.”

But Wilken and Gerth had finally understood what was happening and I heard them shout at the assessment team to fall back down the corridor to the shuttle.

I didn’t need to look at my projections again. They weren’t going to make it to the end of the corridor. This is why humans shouldn’t work security; the situation changes too fast and they can’t keep up.

I had sent the lift to the bio pod, the nearest junction to the team’s position. The door slid open and I stepped into a wall of sound: screaming, energy weapon fire. I ran down the corridor and rounded the corner.

I’m going to describe this as I reconstructed it from my and Miki’s camera feeds later, since at the time even I was mostly thinking, Oh shit oh shit.

Wilken and Gerth had managed to get the group out of the bio hub, up the ramp, and into a junction with three other corridors, which was pretty much the most optimal point for being attacked in this area. I mean, if I was going to attack someone, I couldn’t have picked a better spot.

I didn’t have time to be too sarcastic about it because Wilken and Gerth were discharging their weapons down the corridor curving off to the left. Even the emergency power lights down there were off and I couldn’t immediately see what they were shooting at. Ejiro was against the far wall, just sliding to the floor like something had slammed him aside. The rightward corridor led to the next segment of the bio pod and there was a lock and heavy hatch that was in the process of sliding closed. Miki, trying to follow my instructions, had triggered it via the emergency access on the wall. Brais staggered as if she’d been hit by something, and Abene grabbed her by the arm and steadied her.

It looked like all the humans were intact and Wilken and Gerth were driving off whatever it was they had blundered out here to meet and try to feed their clients to, and I was about to fall back. Then in the closing gap between the hatch and the wall, something moved. It was too fast for me to make it out without rerunning my video and reviewing it. Almost before I could move, it reached past Miki, grabbed Don Abene by the helmet, and yanked her into the gap.

Almost before I could move.

I crossed the junction toward them, ducked past Miki and Brais, hit the wall, used my momentum to go up two meters so I was level with Don Abene’s body. I braced myself in the corner, planted one foot against the closing hatch and pushed. I felt the strain even in my inorganic parts; I couldn’t keep it open for long.

One of Abene’s flailing legs hit Brais and knocked her to the floor. Miki was the only one fast enough to act. It grabbed Don Abene’s torso, and its whole feed was one scream of an urgent assistance code. I got an arm around Abene’s waist, pinning one of her arms. The other was desperately scrabbling to hold onto Miki.

If she hadn’t been wearing the suit, she would have been torn in half. If the hatch hadn’t had a safety sensor that was giving us time to clear the obstruction, she would have been crushed. I wasted three seconds trying to pry at the spidery thing gripping her helmet. It was red and had eight multi-jointed fingers, that was all I could tell at the moment. Then I thought of the obvious solution. The air was breathable, and she could be treated for possible contamination as long as she still had her head. 

I felt around her neck, slowed down by the unfamiliar suit design, then my fingers hit the little tab. (I would never have found it in time in my armor; the human skin overlay on my hands is much more sensitive.) I pressed the tab and twisted, and the emergency release unlocked her helmet. It was stuck in the door for almost a full second, enough time for me to push off and twist away. Then the thing on the other side snatched it out of the gap and the hatch snapped closed. I landed on my feet holding Don Abene, head still attached.

She slumped against me, gasping, her hands knotted in my jacket. Miki was at my shoulder, worriedly poking at her feed, its long fingers gently lifting her hair to check her neck. It said, “Don Abene, do you need medical assistance? Don Abene, please answer.”

Gerth and Wilken stopped firing down the corridor, and my scan showed whatever was down there was long gone. From the floor, Brais gasped, “What was— Are you—” Ejiro, curled up at the base of the wall, shouted, “Abene!”

I was congratulating myself (because nobody else ever does it) on an excellent save. Human security had literally just noticed that something had tried to steal their client’s head. Then Gerth said, “That’s a SecUnit!”

All the humans stared at me and Abene. More importantly, Wilken and Gerth had pointed their weapons at me. Oh, Murderbot, what did you do?

(I don’t even know. I suspect it has to do with the fact that I went from being told what to do and having every action monitored to being able to do whatever I wanted, and somewhere along the way my impulse control went to hell.)

The only way out of this was to kill them.

If I did that, I’d have to kill all of them. Including Miki. Including Abene. Her still-attached head was resting against my collarbone and her hair was all warm and soft where it was in contact with my human skin.

Right, so the only smart way out of this was to kill all of them. I was going to have to take the dumb way out of this.

I made sure my face and voice were SecUnit neutral. I said, “I’m a SecUnit under contract to Security Consultant Rin, who was sent by GoodNightLander Independent as an extra security measure for the assessment team.” I had to admit I was a SecUnit; there was no augmented human who could do what I just did. Also, my right sleeve was still rolled up, exposing the weapon port in my forearm. (The inorganic parts around the port might look like an augment designed to correct an injury, but the weapon port doesn’t look like anything else but what it is.)

It was at this point I remembered Miki, and how I had told it I was an augmented human security consultant. I had been in Miki’s feed, the connection so intimate even though I’d had my walls up. Miki would know that the Rin it had been talking to this whole time was the SecUnit standing here. Yeah, I should have taken Miki over earlier when I had the chance; there was no time to do it now.

In my private connection to Miki, I said, Please, Miki, I just want to help.

Miki cocked its head at me, then at Abene. Still dazed, and possibly concussed, she hadn’t let go of me yet. She stared up at me, her brow wrinkled in confusion. Following my wounded human protocol, I had upped my body temperature to try to prevent her from going into shock. She said, “Miki…? Who is this?”

Miki said, “Security Consultant Rin is my friend, Don Abene. I was asked not to tell you, to keep you safe.”

Huh. That wasn’t a lie, but it sure wasn’t the truth, either. Maybe Miki had hidden depths.

I saw Gerth throw a startled glance at Wilken. Wilken reacted but controlled it. They didn’t speak on their feed connection. From the shuttle, Kader demanded an update, asking if the team needed assistance. Brais said, “Ejiro is injured.” She pushed herself up the wall, shaking. “Is Abene all right? What happened?”

Abene started to nod, then winced. She patted my arm and pushed away a little, and I let her stand on her own. “I’m fine…” On the feed, she told Kader to hold his position. Aloud, she said, “Ejiro, how are you hurt?”

“It’s my shoulder,” Ejiro said. His voice indicated stress, his expression tense with pain. I started to tap MedSystem and remembered I didn’t have one. (I know, I was all over the place.) Ejiro added, “What were those things? I couldn’t see, just shapes.”

Wilken and Gerth still aimed their weapons at me. Don Abene and Miki were blocking clear shots from this angle and if either Wilken or Gerth moved, I was going to have to do something about it.

Then Miki said, “Don Abene, Hirune is missing and is not answering her feed or comm.”

Well, crap. They weren’t my humans, I hadn’t done a head count. I checked Hirune’s feed, feeling Abene, Wilken, Gerth, Brais, and Ejiro all in there, too, calling for her. Her feed was still online, but it was inactive. That meant she was alive, but unconscious. I wasn’t getting anything on my limited range scan, and neither was Miki.

On the comm from the shuttle, I heard Vibol cursing and Kader telling her to shut up and listen.

Abene’s expression turned horrified. In the general feed, Miki replayed the last seconds before I got here. Breaking the images down, I saw a fast-moving shadowy shape approach from the main bio pod access corridor, just a sensor ghost in Miki’s vision when Miki had hit the release to close the hatch. Then Miki had turned to go to the corridor that led toward the central facility, but was too late. All it had was a glimpse of the pinlights on Hirune’s suit disappearing into the dark as she was dragged away, then Wilken and Gerth firing down the corridor after her. It had happened so fast, I don’t think Wilken and Gerth had realized the hostile had taken Hirune.

As the humans reviewed the video in the team feed, Ejiro looked like he might be sick, and Brais swore softly. Abene turned to Gerth and Wilken. “We have to go after her. What were those things that— Why are you pointing that at me?”

They weren’t pointing their weapons at her, but at me, just behind her. Wilken said, “That’s a SecUnit, Don Abene, you need to step away from it until we sort this out. Where’s this Rin? On the facility somewhere? It doesn’t mesh with our brief from GI.”

Abene had been in shock but I could practically see her brain slam back online. Her jaw set and her expression turned hard. She countered, “Where’s Hirune? What took her? You’re supposed to be our security.”

Wilken held her ground. “Before we can look for her, I need to know why there’s a SecUnit here. It’s a fair question.”

Miki sent into Abene’s feed, Please Don Abene, Rin is my friend. Please say you knew Rin was here.

I thought there was no way Abene would take the word of her pet robot. (And granted, her pet robot was being loose with the facts, and phrasing the plea in a way that made it unclear that Consultant Rin and the SecUnit were actually the same, so its word wasn’t worth much.)

Abene’s angry gaze went from Wilken to Gerth. She said, “I didn’t know Rin would be on the facility. GI informed me before we left. The oversight division was sending Rin to provide additional security—” She threw an opaque glance back at me. “Consultant Rin sent you?”

Fortunately I hadn’t just been standing there like a moron and didn’t drop the perfectly good opening she was trying to hand me. “I’m Consultant Rin’s contracted SecUnit. Consultant Rin is on the station, and sent me to the facility on her shuttle.” 

Gerth said, “We weren’t told about this.” Wilken snapped a glare at her. Still no conversation between them on any private feed connection. There were a lot of questions they could ask. The scenario I had described, a client sending a SecUnit out to provide security for another set of clients, was technically possible, but would violate bond company regulations and warranties. But Gerth took her weapon off me and pointed it where it should be, on the still-open corridor where the hostile had taken Hirune.

Abene snapped, “I don’t care what you were told! We need to find Hirune! Brais, you have to get Ejiro back to the ship. Gerth, you go with them. Wilken, either help me or give me a gun and go back to the ship with the others.” She switched to her feed to say, Kader, inform the station PA of our situation. Tell them we’re not sure what attacked us yet. Tell them to be wary of possible raiders in the system. Kader acknowledged.

I can’t help it, I like it when the humans are decisive. (Especially when it’s the human who’s in favor of not shooting me.) I said, “Consultant Rin has instructed me to help you in any way necessary.” I kept my gaze on Abene because I was a SecUnit and that was what a SecUnit would do. You talk to the client and leave the people holding the guns to decide if they should feel threatened by what you said or not. (They should, they should feel really threatened.)

Wilken said hurriedly, “We’re your security team, Don Abene, of course we’ll go. But you should get back to the ship with Gerth and the others, and I’ll go after Hirune with Rin’s SecUnit.”

Ejiro struggled to stand and Brais got under his good arm and levered him upright. Brais said, “I’m on the feed with Kader, Abene. Vibol’s prepping the medical bay.”

Since I was the SecUnit now and everything, I said, “Don’t take a lift. The hostile may take control of the system and bring a lift to its position.”

“I know that,” Gerth snapped.

I know you know that, asshole.

Brais nodded at me and promised, “No lifts.” She told Abene, “Please be careful.”

Abene said, “You, too. Keep in contact with Kader.” She turned to Wilken. “I don’t have time to argue. We need to go.”

Miki turned and started down the open corridor. Gerth had to step out of its way. Abene picked up her helmet and followed Miki. Wilken hesitated but gave Gerth a tap on the feed. Gerth motioned to Ejiro and Brais. “Come on, it’ll be okay.”

I waited until Wilken started after Abene, lengthening her stride to get in front. I moved up level with Abene, and backburnered Brais’s feed so I could keep tabs on the group heading back to the shuttle.

Sounding professionally competent and not at all like someone who had just let a client get abducted, Wilken said, “My scan’s not showing anything, but my range is limited. As long as Hirune’s feed is still up, we can track her with it.”

Really, you think? Miki had already set that up and informed Abene. I hadn’t done anything yet but try not to panic.

I tapped my private channel to Miki and then had no idea what to say. (“Thank you for not exposing my lies” seemed a little too blatant.) Then Miki said, You saved Don Abene, Rin/SecUnit.

I had the feeling I needed to review my conversations with Miki and see where I went wrong. Did you know I was a SecUnit, Miki?

I don’t know what being a SecUnit means. It’s not included in my knowledge base. What should I call you if you’re not Rin anymore?

Call me SecUnit. I had somehow committed myself to acting as a security consultant and I wasn’t even going to get another hard currency card for it this time. As usual, I had no one to blame but myself. I thought it could turn out okay, though. All we had to do was retrieve Hirune, and then I’d think up a reason for why I needed a ride back on their shuttle, say I had to return to Consultant Rin, and then run off.

And possibly it could turn out better than okay. If GrayCris was behind the attack, then I could get video evidence of it to send back to Dr. Mensah along with my geo pod data.

The corridor was dark, and from her camera video Wilken was using her night-filter. Marker emergency lights on the floor and walls came on as we passed. Swearing softly, Abene tried to get her helmet back on, but I had broken the tab getting it off. She leaned down to leave it on the floor and asked Wilken, “Do you have any idea what attacked us? Some kind of bot? A retrieval device?”

That was a good guess, actually. I had one good image of the spidery hand thing, and I figured a comparison with the inventory of the bio pod would show it was something intended to work with or as part of a device designed to obtain surface samples. With the facility’s system cores removed, there was no way to run that inventory. My theory was that the hostile that Miki had heard approaching had activated and used the retrieval device to distract the team while it grabbed Hirune. Wilken said, “My camera didn’t pick it up. I believe raiders are in the facility and using the equipment left behind here against us. SecUnit, does Consultant Rin have any confirmation of that?”

I said, “Consultant Rin has no additional intel,” because why should I do her work for her when I wasn’t even getting a hard currency card, am I right?

On the feed, Abene asked Miki, Miki, are you sure about this Consultant Rin? When did she contact you?

On the station, Miki replied. Rin is my friend. GI sent Rin to help you stay safe. It added, You were almost hurt, and Wilken and Gerth didn’t try to help you at all.

They were trying to protect Ejiro and Brais, Abene said absently, her mind obviously on something else, probably how terrible my cover story was. There was no time.

I didn’t want her thinking about the likelihood of mysteriously appearing SecUnits and their (possibly apocryphal) security consultant contractors. I tapped her feed and said, Don Abene, you can speak to me privately on this channel. I maintain contact with my clients at all times. Please note that Consultant Rin has specified that you are my principal client, not your security team.

I was trying to let her know I was on her side, not theirs. I probably could have phrased it better. But I was pretty certain there were going to be sides, since Wilken and Gerth clearly didn’t believe it would be possible to recover Hirune.

That’s the other problem with human security: they’re allowed to give up.

Abene took a second to regroup, then asked me, Do you know what took Hirune?

I noted she had asked me again, directly, despite having heard the exchange with Wilken. Abene figured there were going to be sides, too. I said, I think you’re correct, I think it was a retrieval device. The hostile intended to take at least one member of the team and kill or injure others before retreating. That is not something a party of raiders would do. I added, Its plan is probably to draw you further into the facility to kill the rest of you, and hopefully cause more members of the team to leave the shuttle so it can kill them, too. Trying to make things sound less dire than they are never helps. The client has to believe your assessment of the situation is accurate. (And I know, not my client.)

She took three seconds to process the fact that we were doing what the hostile probably wanted us to do. But we have to find Hirune. Is there a way to counter it?

You’ve already countered it. It doesn’t know you have a SecUnit with you. For a human, that would be a hormone-fueled ego talking. For a SecUnit, it’s just a fact. Like I told Tlacey before I killed her, I’m just telling you what I’m going to do. 

Abene went quiet for five more seconds while we walked along the dark corridor. Then she asked, Did you know there was something dangerous here? Did you know we would be attacked?

I didn’t know, not until Miki alerted me that something was approaching your position. That was true. I would much rather be hiding on the shuttle watching entertainment media right now. Consultant Rin had no intel on hostiles inside the facility.

Where were you? What did Rin really send you to do here?

I flailed mentally. Did I lie, did I tell the truth? It had to mesh with what I’d already told Miki, which was only partly a lie, sort of, and Abene might not register my hesitation but Miki would notice it unless I answered right now—I was in the geo pod, I said in desperation. I was gathering data about a possible violation by GrayCris of the Strange Synthetics Accord.

Ah, Don Abene said. This begins to make sense. She hesitated. Can you save Hirune? If she’s still alive.

Yes. I’m pretty sure.

Abene let out her breath. Good, then. We’ll work together.

Telling the truth was sort of working out for me.

We came out of the dark section into another corridor with low but active lighting. Wilken said, “Have you ever worked with a SecUnit before, Don Abene?”

“No. They’re illegal in the homesystems.” She was impatient. Right now she didn’t want to hear anything from Wilken that didn’t involve getting her friend back.

We were nearing a junction. Wilken signaled a halt through the feed, and paused while she took a scan. I was scanning continuously, but my readings were shit. The static had to be interference from the storm. Wilken continued, “I know you’re close to your bot, but that thing is not like Miki. It’s a killing machine.”

Abene looked up at me and it was probably a mistake, but I looked down at her. It was surprisingly easy to make eye contact and not be nervous, maybe because I was used to seeing her face through Miki’s feed. She touched her neck, the mark where the helmet rim had pressed in when the retrieval device had tried to wrench her head off. Her gaze went to Wilken’s back again, but on our private channel she said, I’ve never worked with a SecUnit before—I’ve never seen or interacted with a SecUnit before—so please tell me if you need any information or instruction from me.

I had never had a human ask me how to give me orders before. It was an interesting novelty. I have standing orders from Rin to assist you. I can do the rest.

Wilken’s scan picked up some interference, the same static at the edge of the range that both Miki and I were getting. We started to move again, taking the right-hand corridor leading away from the junction. Abene asked me, Can you tell me why GI didn’t inform me that there was a second assessment underway?

I had an answer for this one and everything. GrayCris has been accused of killing the members of a DeltFall survey team and attacking a PreservationAux team on a Corporation Rim assessment world. When you have access to newsfeeds again, check references to Port FreeCommerce for more information. There was reason to suspect GrayCris used this terraforming facility for interdicted activity and might try to prevent a reclamation effort. That was all true, and it even sounded good when I said it.

I see. Abene sounded grim. So GrayCris was using the facility to mine strange synthetics instead of to terraform, and they suspected a detailed survey of the remaining equipment would reveal it.

Probably. I was certain of it, but it was longtime habit to give myself wiggle room if it turned out I was wrong. It didn’t usually manage to prevent punishment from the governor module, but it was always worth a shot. Until the geo pod data is reviewed and analyzed, we won’t know for certain. Consultant Rin decided it was best to combine the data retrieval with additional security for your team.

Ahead the corridor ended in an open space. Wilken signaled a halt, five seconds after I would have done it. The schematic said this was a transition zone between pods. The shadows ahead moved, but I could tell it was reflections from outside. There was a large view port to the left, like the one in the geo pod but in the wall, and the play of light and clouds cast shadows across the floor.

Wilken used her scan unit, then motioned us to move forward with her. The interference was worse but I was getting nothing on audio. I asked Miki, Can you tell what’s causing that scanner noise?

No, SecUnit. I compared it to the static caused by the weather, and it looks the same, but it has a different source. That’s strange, isn’t it?

Wilken led the way into the large space, into the shadows from the storm churning on the other side of the transparent wall. Most of her attention was still on her scanner. Supports curved and twisted overhead, solid stationary metal somehow mimicking the constant motion of the cloud layers outside. There were three tall arched locks, open now to dark corridors leading off toward different pods. A gallery ran three quarters of the way around, opposite the transparent wall, with more corridor accesses. Miki’s feed locater pointed toward the third corridor on the right on this level.

It’s not strange, it’s strategic, I told Miki. Something is using the interference caused by the weather to mask a signal. It was also frustrating. I missed having a SecSystem to do a real analysis. Even if we could break down the signal, I just didn’t have the databases to match it to anything.

Miki switched to the general feed, Don Abene, there is a signal using the storm interference to—

I sensed motion, the whisper of sound as joints moved, and I flashed a warning to Miki just as a shape exploded off the gallery overhead. I caught Abene around the waist and bolted for that third corridor on the right, because that was the direction we needed to go to achieve our mission objective. Step one was to get there while the hostile was busy with Wilken.

I stopped far enough down the corridor to get Abene out of range of any stray friendly fire. (Wilken’s weapon was discharging so rapidly I assumed she didn’t have a lot of time to aim.)

Miki arrived a second later. I deposited Abene on her feet and she staggered before Miki caught her. Now this is something else I hate about human security. If Wilken was a SecUnit, my priority would be clear: continue ahead to retrieve Hirune, get her and Abene to safety, then return to retrieve/clean up what was left of Wilken and the hostile. But Wilken was human, so I had to go back and retrieve her stupid ass now.

Miki sent an image into my feed and said, It’s a combat bot!

Yeah, thanks for the newsburst, Miki. I’d managed to get a clear picture of it while it was in mid-leap, when I was crossing the room with Abene. I told Miki, Stay with Don Abene, and ran back down the corridor.

Again, I know in the telling it sounds like I was on top of this situation but really, I was still just thinking, Oh shit oh shit oh shit. Combat bots are faster, stronger, and more heavily armed than me. Even if a SecSystem feed had been available, I couldn’t hack a combat bot without making a direct physical connection, and trying for that would result in me being torn apart. (I’ve been torn apart before, and on my list of things to avoid, it was right up there at the top.)

The only good thing about combat bots is that they aren’t combat SecUnits. Those are worse.

I exited the corridor at close to my top speed and had time to get one clear image of the situation to plot my attack. (I should put “plot” in quotes because it’s really hard to plan under these circumstances.) 

Wilken was on the floor and her large weapon had just been knocked out of her hands. The combat bot stooped over her. In shape it was close to a human-form bot. Sort of like Miki if Miki were three meters tall, had multiple weapon ports in its chest and back, four arms with multiple hand mods for cutting, slicing, delivering energy bursts, etc., and a not very endearing personality.

I went up the wall just enough to give myself the right trajectory, then pushed off into a jump and landed on the combat bot’s head. Its cameras and scanners were up there, but the place where it did its actual processing and kept its memory was down in its lower abdomen. (So was Miki’s; it was more protected down there since people always shoot for the head.) (At least, people always shot for my head, so I assumed they did it to bots, too.)

The combat bot knew I was a SecUnit because it sent a pulse through its skin that caused my pain sensors to max out. (I’d anticipated that and already dialed them down, but it didn’t feel good.) The next pulse was meant to fry my armor and my explosive projectile weapon. Since I left both back at Port FreeCommerce, it didn’t do much of anything to me and the mistake gave me the half second I needed to shove the port of the energy weapon in my right arm up against its sensory input collectors. I fired it at full capacity.

I had needed that half second, because just as I fired the bot swept its arm up and slammed me off its head. I hit the floor and slid three meters but the bot staggered sideways, temporarily (and I can’t stress that “temporarily” part enough) blind, deaf, and with no ability to scan for movement or energy, no ability to acquire a target with any of its inbuilt weapons.

Wilken was just rolling over as I shoved upright. I grabbed an explosive pack off her harness and threw myself at the combat bot. From the burst of static in the feed, it had just cleared its sensory inputs, but I’d already hit the spot just above its right hip joint and slammed the explosive pack into place.

It grabbed me by the head and shoulder, big hand gripping me, and I felt the shift in the metal that meant something sharp was about to come out of its hand. I thought, Well, okay, that didn’t work. It could have destroyed me with any one of the many weapons in its chest, but it was mad and it wanted to make me hurt. Then there was a small muffled thump from the explosive pack.

The pack had two charges, and that was the first one, the one designed to bore a tunnel through heavy shielding and would do much the same to a combat bot’s carapace. I still had the channel open to Wilken’s feed and heard the pack’s countdown start.

If the combat bot had been more self-aware, it might have stopped to crush my head, but its defensive mode kicked in and it shoved me away so it could get at the pack.

I hit the floor again and scrambled back as it clawed at the pack. Wilken rolled to her knees and opened fire at the bot’s chest and head. She hit sensors and weapons ports, which granted, was a good idea. It was keeping the bot from targeting us while the charge had a chance to work.

The plastic outer casing came away but the explosive had already tunneled through the bot’s carapace. The bot tried to insert a probe into the hole to get the explosive. Wilken managed to hit the vulnerable joint as it extended. That bought the explosive the extra two seconds it needed. I put my hands over my head, tuned down my hearing, and rolled.

The explosion was muffled but I felt the vibration when the bot’s body hit the floor. I came to my feet, mostly shocked that it had worked and that I was still alive and functional. (That’s how SecUnits are taught to fight: throw your body at the target and kill the shit out of it, and hope they can fix you in a repair cubicle. Yes, I’m aware I didn’t have armor or access to a repair cubicle anymore, very aware, but old habits die hard.)

The bot slumped on the floor like so much salvage. The carapace had contained the explosion, so there was no shrapnel, and the blast had damaged the bot’s processor and the other important bits in its abdomen. But it was still active. I said to Wilken, “I need more packs.”

She was sprawled on the floor, but her armor had protected her hearing. She yanked a set of packs off her harness and held them up.

I took them, armed each one, and dropped them into the bot’s open carapace, then retreated.

Wilken staggered to her feet and backed away, covering the bot.

I reached the corridor entrance as the explosions went off. Each blast made the bot’s body jerk and spasm. After the last one I scanned for activity. The bot still had power, but the charges had destroyed the first and secondary processors. That ought to do it.

Wilken was checking her scan. She made a relieved noise. “Good save. Come on. If there’s one of those things here, there’s more.”

Well, yeah.

I followed Wilken up the corridor to where Miki and Abene waited. Abene had a hand on Miki’s arm, holding on to it almost protectively. As we approached she let go and said, “Whoever activated that thing took Hirune, correct?”

“Has to be.” Wilken tried to stop but Abene started up the corridor, and Wilken had to follow her. I got up in front, and Miki stayed beside Abene without prompting from me. Which was good; Miki might be no help in combat, but at least I knew Abene would be its priority, whatever Wilken told it to do.

I heard Abene in the feed for the shuttle, warning Vibol and the others and telling them again to stay onboard, not to come after us under any circumstances. Wilken sent her camera’s recording of the attack to Gerth, and Gerth sent an acknowledgment. It was more professional than Kader, who was clearly agitated, but reported that they had sent a warning to the transit station and were keeping the PA updated.

Wilken added, “I’ve never seen raiders with access to combat bots, but there’s a first time for everything.”

I was pretty sure the combat bot had been original equipment for the facility. We were talking about GrayCris here, whose company motto seemed to be “profit by killing everybody and taking their stuff.”

Abene didn’t respond. After what I’d told her, she probably didn’t think it was raiders, either. “They’ll know we’re coming.”

They knew that already, I told her and Miki on our private three-way channel. And now the other combat bots would know a SecUnit was in play and adjust their strategy accordingly.

I wish I had a strategy.

[Query: SecUnit active in watch zone.]

I stopped. I did not scream, though I thought about it for .02 of a second.

I was pretty sure I kept my face blank, but Abene and Miki turned to look at me. Wilken kept moving.

I started to walk again, trying to figure out what channel it was coming in on so I could block it.

[Query: respond.]

In my feed, Miki said, SecUnit, what is that?

Don’t answer it, Miki. It’s a combat bot, trying to fix our position. Combat bots can’t hack like combat SecUnits. They don’t work linked to Sec or HubSystems like security SecUnits do. But still. I didn’t want it in my head. Or Miki’s head.

[Query: SecUnit has subordinate unit.] It sounded implacable, and amused. [Query: pet bot.]

I almost had it.

[Objective: We will tear you apart.]

I blocked the channel. I breathed out, slowly, so as not to draw attention from the humans. Miki sent me a glyph of distress. I said, It’s okay, which was a complete lie. I reminded myself a combat bot wasn’t a human, it wasn’t a villain from one of my shows. It was a bot, and it wasn’t threatening us. 

It was just telling us what it was going to do.

Combat bots usually needed a human controller. Well, they needed a human controller when you were trying to achieve an objective. If the objective was as vague as “attack everybody who lands on the facility while disguising your network feed traffic with static designed to match the interference created by the storm,” maybe they didn’t. But taking a prisoner, luring us further into the facility, did suggest a plan. GrayCris might have left an operative on the station, hiding out in plain sight with the Port Authority staff, keeping an eye on the facility. They had known when our shuttle left and when it docked with the facility, and had estimated how long it would take for the team to get into one of the pods and start the assessment. Then they sent a signal to activate the combat bots.

A signal that got through the facility’s shielding? Maybe.

It would be nice to know how many bots, but at least now I knew the location of the first trap. It had failed, so the combat bots would be adjusting their position to create a second trap. I checked the schematic again, verifying that we were about to cross into the central hub.

I said, “Don Abene, I need to scout ahead. It’ll be better if Wilken comes with me, and you and Miki wait here.” I added on the feed, And we need to hurry.

Abene was all for hurrying and I didn’t want to give Wilken time to argue. Abene said, “Yes, go ahead.”

I started up the corridor, walking faster. Wilken hesitated, then followed me, her powered armor letting her catch up. “Hold it,” she said. I stopped, to humor her, and because I could tell from the feed she was checking the schematic. “I see. Let’s move.”

I let Wilken lead the way.

We followed the tube that bypassed the central node to curve toward engineering. I’d been scanning automatically for drones, but I was still turning up a negative result. I tapped Miki’s feed. Have you checked the ship recently?

I’m monitoring Kader’s feed for Don Abene and checking the onboard system status every 2.4 seconds, SecUnit. Ejiro is in the medical suite and is expected to fully recover.

This was the first time I’d heard Miki sound even minimally annoyed. I was vaguely encouraged by that, for some reason. Acknowledged, just checking.

Miki sent me a smile glyph. It’s good to check on our friends.

Well, I’d asked for that.

The tube curved ahead and, as I’d suspected, I saw the shadows and light play that indicated big windows in both walls. What we were about to do was an obvious tactic, and the combat bots could have sent some miniature drones up here to see if we tried it. But I wasn’t picking up any hint of surveillance, movement, or suspicious static on my scan. It was support for the theory that they didn’t have an on-site controller; the schematic didn’t show that these access tubes had windows, it had just seemed likely given the rest of the facility’s design. That wasn’t something a combat bot was going to pick up on.

I stopped inside the shadow of the opaque part of the tube, and Wilken halted nearby. In the feed, I saw she was adjusting the magnification on her helmet cam.

One side of the transparent tube looked down at the engineering pod’s hub. It was only twenty-two meters away at this point, and we had a view through the big curving roof, identical to the one in the geo pod. Wilken put her helmet cam against the tube wall, then sent me the video.

I could see the movement and extrapolate the positions myself, but the greater detail was nice.

One combat bot stalked across the hub floor as we watched, passing under a central sculptural structure that must have been part staircase to the upper gallery level, and part artistic statement. Wilken’s scope registered powered movement in the upper level, and I could tell by the pattern it was a flight of combat drones. Most of my contracts used the much smaller (cheaper) model, designed for intel and better for collecting the clients’ proprietary data, as well as keeping an eye on your base perimeter and making sure nothing snuck up on your teams in the field. These were the bigger model that had intel capacity, extra shielding, and an onboard energy weapon.

Still scanning, Wilken muttered, “So we’ve got one more combat bot, plus the drones.”

We had at least two more combat bots; one was standing back under the shadow of the gallery. Wilken had missed it but I was extrapolating its existence based on the energy patterns Wilken’s scope had picked up. I was willing to bet there were one or two more in reserve, or active somewhere else in the facility. Probably between us and the shuttle, because that’s how these things work.

Then Wilken said, “There’s the target.”

By “target” she meant her client Hirune, lying on the floor next to the foot of the staircase. (You should never refer to the clients as targets; you don’t want to get confused at the wrong moment.) (That’s a joke.) She lay curled on her side, facing away from us, and I couldn’t tell if she was alive. There was something else that worried me. “Why did they choose the engineering pod?”

We had to pass through the central node to get there, and unless there was a trap set there, the atmospheric pod was closer and better defended, as it only had the one entrance. The engineering pod had one access through the central node and a second tube branching off from the production pod, plus a lift junction in the hub, right under that gallery.

“No telling what goes on in bot brains,” Wilken said, then threw a glance at me. I stared straight ahead. If there was one thing good about this situation, it was reinforcing how great my decisions to (a) hack my governor module and (b) escape were. Being a SecUnit sucked. I couldn’t wait to get back to my wild rogue rampage of hitching rides on bot-piloted transports and watching my serials. Wilken added, “Let’s go. I’ve got a plan.”

Yeah, I’ve got a plan, too.

Now that we knew where the combat bots were, Wilken had us take the central node access to the production pod, where we could walk across the alternate tube access to the engineering pod. Or where I could walk across the alternate tube access, because that was her plan.

“We’ll send the SecUnit in to distract them, and then I’ll go in to get Hirune,” Wilken told Abene.

Miki cocked its head. Abene’s brow furrowed, and the look she threw at me was startled. “That’s suicide, surely.”

Wilken said patiently, “It’s a SecUnit. That’s what they do.”

Miki signaled alarm through the feed. This is not a good plan, SecUnit.

Abene’s expression went hard again. “It’s against the GI standards of operation.”

Wilken lifted her brows. “Do you want Hirune back?”

I watched Abene’s face. She was struggling, torn between her fear for Hirune and the thought of sending me into what was probably going to be a terrible but at least abrupt death. It was interesting to watch, because she knew I was a SecUnit. She grated out, “There has to be another way. Consultant Rin would surely not allow this.”

But she had said she had never seen or worked with a SecUnit before, and Miki didn’t even have an entry in its knowledge base for it. And Abene was a human with a pet robot. She might think of me as Consultant’s Rin pet, like Miki was hers.

We didn’t have time to argue, and I really didn’t want anybody thinking about Consultant Rin, whose fictional existence seemed to be increasingly flimsy, at least to me. I said, “It’s all right, Don Abene. It’s what I do.” It was still extremely difficult not to sound ironic. 

On our private connection, I said to her and Miki, It’s all right, I have another plan. It’s safer for Hirune.

Are you sure? Abene said, then, You don’t want to tell Wilken your plan.

No, I didn’t, mostly because I didn’t want her giving me orders I had to ignore. Also because I had only a vague idea of what I wanted to do; most of it was going to be created on the fly. You’re my client. You can monitor me on this connection. I told Wilken, “We should go now. Give me your weapon.”

“What?” Wilken didn’t fall back into a firing position, but the way the armor shifted over her joints made me think that was her first impulse.

I said, “If I’m going in first, I’ll need a projectile weapon.” I just wanted to see what she’d do.

“No, I’m going to follow you in,” Wilken said, not so patiently. “I’ll be at the hatch junction between the production pod corridor and the tube, to give you cover.” She started up the corridor, telling Abene, “Wait here. If I send you a feed message to run, get back to the shuttle.” I followed her, like a good little SecUnit/killing machine.

Behind me, Miki moved to watch us head away up the corridor, sending its camera-view to Abene.

Once we were out of earshot, Wilken muted her comm and feed and said, “Any word from Consultant Rin?”

“No, the station feed isn’t accessible from here.” Which Wilken knew. “I may be able to reach her on comm if you need to speak to her.” I could fake that, but I’d need a little time to work on it.

Fortunately Wilken decided she didn’t want to invite another Security Consultant to give opinions on her strategy, especially since she was planning on getting that Security Consultant’s contracted SecUnit killed. I don’t know what bond companies charge clients when we get killed, but it’s probably a lot.

I figured Wilken’s plan was to send me in, seal the hatch, and when the combat bots killed me, she would tell Abene and Miki that she had tried and now they needed to go back to the shuttle and leave. Without a SecUnit on her side, Abene was unarmed and not wearing powered armor, and Wilken could drag her back if Abene resisted. Of course, if Wilken touched Abene, Miki would intervene, but I’m not sure Wilken realized that.

We reached the hatch junction and Wilken stopped. She said, “Good luck.”

Yeah, fuck you, I thought, and kept walking.

All right, so I wasn’t happy about this. It wasn’t like I had a repair cubicle waiting somewhere. I could repair with a MedSystem but I needed access to one, and the closest one I had any chance of getting to myself was onboard my cargo ship still docked at the station. But I knew I could do this.

(I hoped I could do this. I had been wondering a lot about my judgment lately.)

As I got further up the access tube, out of Wilken’s sight, I backburnered her channel and tapped my connection to Miki and Abene to give them a visual through my feed. (It’s not as good as a helmet camera would be; it uses my eyes to record so it jumps around a lot.) Miki was talking, more to Abene than to me, but I stopped listening. I was fishing for a drone.

I was broadcasting little spurts of static on an open channel. The drone should read it as signals from a vocal comm, like if some poor human was wandering through here, trying to call for help on their comm rather than on the secured interfaces Abene, Miki, and Wilken were using for our feed.

This could blow up in my face in that all the drones might decide to slam through here at once to get me, but I didn’t think that would happen. The bots hadn’t sent them after us yet because they didn’t want us to know they had them, probably because that’s how they intended to attack the shuttle. I was hoping the drones were set to protect the perimeter and a sentry would come to investigate.

I came to a spot where a connector in the tube had empty slots where equipment was supposed to be fitted. It formed shadowy cubbies and I stepped into one. My scan stretched as far as it would go, still sending my tempting intermittent signal. And I got a response. A staticky burst, like a comm trying to reply to me and being drowned out by interference.

A normal SecUnit (you know, one that still had its governor module, less anxious than me but probably more depressed) could do this part, but would be restricted to the canned responses available in the combat stealth module. A drone might be able to recognize those responses as coming from another combat unit and not a human. I didn’t have the combat stealth module anyway (I had never been upgraded with it, probably due to RaviHyral and the whole “killing all the clients” thing, go figure), so I used snippets of dialog from my media storage, extracted and processed to eliminate background noise and music and to remove any identifying code underlying the audio. I sent my prerecorded “Are you—can’t find—where—ship—” artistically obscured with static.

The drone sent another artistic burst of static in response. From its signal strength it was getting closer. I stayed where I was, waiting.

On the feed, Miki said, We’re worried about what you’re doing, SecUnit.

Nothing on scan yet, so I had time to chat. Why are you worried, Miki?

Because we don’t know what you’re doing. Wilken is telling Dr. Abene on her feed that you aren’t doing anything—

The drone had just come into my scan range, moving slowly so as not to alert the human it thought was here. Standing in the dark cubby, I had stopped breathing, stopped any activity it might pick up. I teased it with a little more comm audio. The schematic showed these slots as part of an atmospheric gas sampling station, so the drone had no idea there was room for something human-sized to hide. Confused at the apparently empty passage, it tried to trace the signal. And I pinged it with a compressed list of drone control keys.

(That’s not in the stealth module, and it’s not a function of company-supplied SecSystems. I got it from the proprietary data of a company client who worked on countermeasures for combat drones. I had managed to resist deleting it to fill that space up with new serials. I knew someday it would come in handy.)

One of the keys worked and the drone switched into neutral standby. I wandered around in its control code for a minute or two, making sure I knew how it worked. It, all the other drones (it was reading thirty active), and three combat bots were all operating on a secured feed. All the drones were in the engineering pod foyer with two of the combat bots. The third bot was reading as active in the facility, but there was no location for it. (I had a bad feeling it was heading toward the shuttle to cut us off.) The bots had more layers of security and even now, from within their own network, if I started trying to hack them they’d have time to run up here and kill me. But I could take control of all the drones.

In another twenty seconds, they were all my new drone friends.

Oh, I see, Miki said. Never mind.

But I was going to have to move fast. I told Drone One to remain in standby, and ordered the twenty-nine others to turn on the two combat bots in the engineering pod. Then I started to run.

I rounded a curve, went through two open hatch junctions. I was already hearing energy and projectile weapon fire, metal smashing against walls, and that funny high-pitched whine combat drones make when attacked. I wasn’t controlling them individually; once given the order, the drones knew what to do, and me trying to jumpseat pilot them would just slow them down. 

I accelerated as the hatch entrance to the engineering pod came into sight. I reached the end of the corridor at top speed and threw myself forward into a dive.

The hub foyer was now a warzone. I hit the floor and slid out across it. The combat bot nearest the door flailed wildly at the cloud of drones firing and diving at it. It thrashed around like an irritated metal whirlwind, stray blasts from its weapons hitting the walls, the floor, the columns. It smacked a drone with its cutting hand and shrapnel sprayed the room. I’d tuned down my pain sensors in anticipation, but I still felt impacts all over my back and shoulders, little thumps that I knew meant something had cut through my clothes and pierced my skin. (Does that sound terrifying? Because it was terrifying.) The second bot tried to run forward but the drones made a wall and slammed into it, forcing it back with a haze of weapon fire and their own armored bodies.

I rolled to my feet, dove again, and landed next to Hirune. Her body looked intact and I didn’t see any blood pools, but I didn’t have time to check if she was alive. (It didn’t matter. In a retrieval like this, humans wouldn’t believe the hostage was dead unless I brought the body back.) I scooped her up and here came the hard part, I had to run out of the foyer.

The bots had had time to figure out (a) the SecUnit was here (b) what the SecUnit had done to take over their drones and consequently (c) they were really pissed off at that SecUnit. I bolted across the room toward the door.

The two bots had taken out twenty-three of the drones, each one a light, a connection, blinking out of my awareness. But the drones had done a lot of damage, targeting joints, weapons ports, and hands. A camera view from a surviving drone told me the bot behind me had lunged for my retreating back but crashed to its knees; drones had been concentrating fire on its ankle joints while others distracted it.

The bot in front of me threw itself forward to block the door. And I turned right and ran straight for the lift junction.

The combat bots had taken over the lift system like I’d warned Brais, but combat bots can’t hack like a SecUnit. I hadn’t tried for control of the whole system, just this one lift, telling it to wait here for me. The door slid obediently open as I reached it. I ordered it to take me to the production pod. The door slammed on a set of sharp metal fingers and the pod whisked me away.

Drone One was still waiting in the corridor, and I ordered it to close the junction hatches between the engineering pod and the production pod, drill through the walls, and fuse the controls. It whizzed into action as the lift stopped and opened its doors.

I stepped out into an empty junction in the production pod, and sent the code I’d prepared into the lift system. It shut the system down and set a password lock. The combat bots could get past it if they had the right code modules, and if they devoted resources to it that they could be using for other things. It would still buy me the time I needed. I hoped.

Now that I had time to evaluate my own condition, I eased up my pain sensors a little. The impacts I’d felt turned from dull aches to sharp burning, like little explosions under my skin. Ow, ow, okay, ow. I locked my knee joints to stay upright and upped my air intake.

I had taken multiple shrapnel hits from the drones being shredded all around me. I had two hits from projectile weapons, one in my lower left side and one in my left shoulder. I was pretty certain I had been hit by stray shots meant for drones. If the bots had been able to target me, I would be in pieces. I tuned down my pain sensors and the impact sites faded from explosions down to embers. (I know that’s actually not a permanent solution and pretending bad things aren’t happening is not a great survival strategy in the long run, but there was nothing I could do about it now.) The arm where I was storing my memory clips was undamaged, which was a relief.

I started down the corridor toward the production pod foyer, where the others should be.

I tapped Miki’s feed for a report because neither it nor Abene were saying anything and I wasn’t sure what they had been able to see through my visual feed. At that point, Hirune’s gloved hand squeezed my shoulder.

Fortunately I remembered I was carrying a possibly living human and didn’t scream or drop her or anything. Her helmet with its comm mic had been ripped off, and her head rested on my shoulder. She slurred the words, “Who are you?”

I was distracted, and what came out of my buffer was the standard, “I’m your contracted SecUnit.” I was distracted because confused noise was coming from the connection with Miki and Abene. It wasn’t communication from a feed interface, it was audio; Miki was sending me open comm audio over the feed.

Her voice rough and deep with fury, Abene shouted, “Who sent you? GrayCris?”

On my shoulder, Hirune made a confused “huh?” sound.

The other comm audio I could hear was too faint even for me to tell what it was. I had to waste four seconds converting it to a spectrogram before I recognized it. It was two noises, the low pitch of Miki’s joints and the higher pitch of powered armor, bracing against each other.

Well, shit.

I do make mistakes (I keep a running tally in a special file) and it looked like I had made a big one. I had interpreted all of Wilken’s behavior as being about me, about the discomfort and paranoia associated with a SecUnit suddenly appearing out of nowhere, supposedly sent by another security consultant whose existence implied that the clients didn’t trust her and Gerth. (I know, the “it’s all about me” bit is usually a human thing.) But now it seemed she had been uneasy for a whole other reason.

The good thing about getting your security through a bond company like the one that had owned me is that for small contracts you take delivery at a company office, and for big ones it arrives in a company transport. This greatly reduces opportunities for somebody to show up pretending to be your security team when they’ve really been contracted to kill you.

Wilken and Gerth were good. I had listened in on and analyzed their conversations aboard Ship and not picked up any hint of it. But then, if they worked for GrayCris, they would be alert for the kind of bond company security surveillance in use throughout the Corporation Rim.

By this point my drone had reached the hatch junction where Wilken was supposed to be waiting. She wasn’t there, obviously, being busy betraying her clients. (When I said I didn’t like humans working security you thought I was just being an asshole, right?)

I used my connection to Miki’s feed and accessed its camera view. Oh yeah, not good. The image was shaky but I could see Miki had Wilken backed up against a pillar. Miki had one arm pinning Wilken’s right wrist against the pillar, as Wilken tried to bring her projectile weapon down to bear on Abene. Something was wrong with Miki’s hand but I didn’t have a clear view, and I didn’t want to distract Miki at the moment by pulling a damage report. Wilken had her other forearm braced against Miki’s face, like she was trying to shove it away, but that wasn’t what she was doing. She had energy weapons built into the forearms of her armor and she was trying to slide one into position to blow Miki’s head off.

(Miki could operate without its head, but its sensory inputs and cameras were there, and it would be really awkward.)

Wilken had cut me out of her feed connection, but I used Abene’s to bypass the block: This is SecUnit. We can talk about this. Consultant Rin can offer you immunity from prosecution if you testify. I hoped that made sense (it was a line from Sanctuary Moon) and I’m sure it sounded like I was stalling. I wasn’t stalling and I didn’t need her to answer me, I just needed her distracted enough to not think about what I was doing in her feed. Your bosses are going down. Whatever they paid you, it won’t make up for a stint in prison. (Yeah, that was from Sanctuary Moon, too.) In the meantime, I was frantically looking for the right code. The companies that make powered armor are different from the ones that make SecSystems, intel drones, cameras, and so on, and their system architectures were different and it made everything harder. 

Abene had a grip on Wilken’s projectile weapon, trying to help Miki wrench it away, but couldn’t do much against the powered armor. I could tell she had no idea about the forearm energy weapon, which was in a much more dangerous position. In the feed, I could hear Abene telling Miki to let go and run, and Miki refusing on the basis that Wilken would then shoot Abene. Who should be running, frankly, but wasn’t going without Miki, obviously.

I reached the turn into the production pod’s foyer where Abene and Miki struggled with Wilken. Her energy weapon slid slowly but inexorably into position next to Miki’s head, despite its attempts to hold her and Abene hanging off her other arm and kicking her. In about thirty seconds I was going to have to put Hirune down on the floor and do this the hard way, if I couldn’t find this code.

On yet another channel, Drone One reported that it couldn’t detect any activity suggesting that the combat bots were trying to blast their way through the hatches it had sealed and jammed. The drone had been cut off from the network and couldn’t report further on the movements of any active units. Which meant that the combat bots had stopped to repair each other (Yes, they’re self-repairing unless their main processing center is destroyed. Yes, that is a pain in the ass and also terrifying.) and would soon be taking another route out of the engineering pod to come after us. Like I didn’t have enough to do right now.

Frantically scanning Wilken’s armor, I finally found the right code. That was a relief. I opened a channel and sent the “freeze” command via the feed.

The reason the company doesn’t use powered armor like Wilken’s is not only because the company is cheap. Powered armor like Wilken’s is hackable.

Miki twisted free and stepped backward, still keeping its body between Wilken and Abene. Wilken froze in place (literally) her face grimacing as she shouted into a comm that wasn’t working anymore. (I had cut off her comm and feed; I wanted current developments to be a surprise to Gerth.) The projectile weapon started to fall from Wilken’s frozen fingers and Abene lunged forward and grabbed it.

Now I could see Miki’s damage; it had two energy impacts on its chestplate and its right hand was a stump.

I said, “It’s all right, I’ve locked her armor.” I ran Miki’s feed back, skimming it to see what had happened. Wilken had waited until I was busy with the combat bots, then had returned to Abene and Miki. She had moved toward them fast, saying she had something important to tell them off the comm and feed. Then she had grabbed Abene by her hair. It was still hanging loose, her helmet left behind after I’d broken the release tab to get her away from the bio sampler.

Wilken had pointed the weapon at Abene’s head and said, “Sorry, it’s not personal.” That comment had cost her the kill, it had given Miki time to slam in between them and force the weapon up and away. (Just because Miki was a pet bot that carried things for humans didn’t mean it wasn’t strong enough to take on powered armor.) Wilken had fired the weapon, destroying Miki’s hand, which hadn’t slowed Miki down, either.

Abene saw me and gasped, “Hirune—”

“She’s alive,” I said, because Abene was armed now and traumatized humans with unsecured weapons make me nervous.

Miki said plaintively, “SecUnit, Consultant Wilken tried to shoot Don Abene.”

Abene slung the weapon over her shoulder and hurried to me. She touched Hirune’s face, then looked up at me. “Oh thank you, thank you.”

It’s nice to be thanked. “Miki, damage report.”

“I am at eighty-six percent functional capacity.” It held up its arm stump. “It’s only a flesh wound.”

For fuck’s sake. Abene turned toward it, shocked. “Miki, your poor hand!”

Oh good, another Abene/Miki lovefest. I said, “Miki, take Hirune.”

Miki stepped forward and held out its arms. Hirune was only semiconscious but had a convulsive grip on my jacket. Abene gently pried her hand away and I deposited her into Miki’s arms.

I turned to Wilken. It was the hair-grabbing thing that bothered me. Along with the snide “it’s not personal.” If Wilken had shot with no warning, Abene would be dead and Miki would be in pieces now. But Wilken had wanted Abene to know that she was betrayed. That was personal.

I don’t like personal.

This was another reason I didn’t like human security consultants. Some of them enjoyed their job too much.

I stepped up to Wilken and pulled off the utility harness that held the explosive packs and other gear. She glared at me through the faceplate. I slung the harness over my shoulder and said, “Don Abene, you might not want to watch this.”

Abene turned away from Miki and Hirune. “No!” Then she added more calmly, “I know you’re angry that she sent you to the combat bots, but don’t kill her.”

I wasn’t angry on my account. Being sent into situations to get shot at was literally my job, or had been my job. I thought everything had happened so fast Abene hadn’t had time to process what Wilken had nearly done to her.

It must have been obvious that her first argument was not compelling, because Abene continued, “If she’s working for GrayCris, we need her as a witness.”

Okay, that did make sense. The whole reason I was here was to find more evidence against GrayCris. I looked into Wilken’s faceplate. Her expression had gone blank, trying to conceal fear. With her comm and feed down, she could still hear us, though our voices would sound like we were at the bottom of a mining tunnel. When it powered down, the armor had automatically opened some vents to allow air circulation, so she wouldn’t suffocate or cook in her own heat. I could give it a delayed command to close the vents once we’d left, and Abene would think it was an accident.

There’s that caring thing again. Did I care if Wilken survived or not? Not really.

I said, “We need to go,” and held out my hand for Wilken’s projectile weapon. Abene handed it to me, and I walked away. I left the vents open.

As Miki and Abene followed me, I said, “The bots in the engineering pod will be trying to reach us once they self-repair, and the drone I captured says that there’s one more active combat bot. It’s probably somewhere between us and the shuttle.” We also knew they would use whatever mobile equipment was left behind in the facility against us. I didn’t want to have to fight another bio sampler.

Abene lengthened her stride to keep up with me. “I can’t reach the shuttle on my feed or comm,” she said. “Neither can Miki.”

“That’s because I’m blocking you,” I told her. “I didn’t want you to say anything that might alert Gerth.” At least not until I figured out what to do about Gerth. I couldn’t get to her armor from here, even if I unblocked the feed. The codes for the armor were unique to each unit (the manufacturers weren’t completely stupid) so I had to be close enough to be able to scan for them.

“I see.” Abene, amazingly, didn’t argue. Or maybe it wasn’t amazingly; she was pretty smart. “I suppose it’s too much to hope that Gerth is not also a hired killer.”

“Analysis from the cargo ship suggested they had worked together for some time,” I said. “We have to assume they were suborned together, or at some point deflected and replaced the security team your company sent.” 

“Deflected,” Abene repeated. “That means killed?”

“Probably.” When I picked up the Milu cargo ship on HaveRatton, I hadn’t downloaded any local news, just the bursts about Port FreeCommerce and GrayCris. If there had been reports of two bodies discovered with all identification burned out, I had missed them. (You can’t space people off a transit ring; security looks for that kind of thing and gets very agitated about it.) “With Gerth at the ship, we have a hostage situation.”

I hate hostage situations. Even when I’m the one with the hostages.

Miki said, “That’s not good.”

See, that? That is just annoying. That contributed nothing to the conversation and was just a pointless vocalization to make the humans comfortable.

In her feed, Abene was doing a quick review of my video from the engineering pod. It was less than a minute, so it didn’t take her long. She said, “Was Wilken giving the bots orders? Perhaps they will go dormant without her. But if they report to Gerth, we’re back in the same situation.”

“I don’t think she or Gerth gave them orders,” I said. “I was listening in on their feeds, and I would have heard that, even if it was encrypted.” They hadn’t spoken to each other much at all, which was maybe suspicious in itself. (I know, hindsight is awesome.)

Miki said, “The combat bots could have been in standby and received instructions to activate once anyone arrived at the facility.” Hirune stirred and murmured and Miki responded, “There, there, Hirune. It’s all right.”

Well, yeah, I thought of that already.

Abene was saying, “I don’t understand this. If Wilken and Gerth were sent to kill us, why were the combat bots sent here? Obviously GrayCris wants to stop the assessment, but that’s—”

I said, “Hold it,” and stopped. I needed to do a quick review of my video and prove or disprove this theory and there’s only so many things I can do while walking and scanning for hostiles without a Sec-or HubSystem to help. I let Miki view my feed as I started my analysis, and I was distantly aware of Miki explaining to Abene what I was doing.

I pinged my drone and told it to open its log and query its records and build a list of activations, standbys, and sleep phases. Then I pulled my copy of Miki’s video of the first attack when Hirune had been taken, and did a quick review of it and my video of the second attack, when the combat bot had gone after Wilken. I finished and then checked the log digest the drone had ready for me. (It was really nice to work with such an advanced drone.)

“The combat bots and drones weren’t sent here for you,” I reported to Abene. “They were part of the facility’s manifest from the start. The transit station was still in construction at that point, and wouldn’t have been much help in driving off potential raiders. And GrayCris wouldn’t have wanted to call on any outside agency for help, since they were trying to conceal the fact that they were building an illegal mining platform disguised as a terraforming facility.” And the bots probably weren’t here just for protection from raiders, but also to keep any human workers in line. “The combat bots and drones have been in sleep mode since the facility was abandoned. They were activated when your shuttle docked here. Analysis suggests Wilken and Gerth were surprised by their existence.” A bot analysis would have missed that entirely, but I’m better at reading human faces and voices. (The organic parts in my head do come in handy for that, and of course it was much easier on recorded video, when I could do freezes and zoom-ins, and not in anxiety-causing realtime.) “I think Wilken did believe it was raiders who staged the attack and took Hirune, up until the second attack when she saw the combat bot. There’s a good chance GrayCris didn’t tell her and Gerth about the combat bots, hoping that the bots would eliminate them.” And helpfully tie up any loose ends.

I wondered how Wilken felt about that. It sure hadn’t made her hesitate to finish her mission. She had expected me to be destroyed by the combat bots; she meant to kill Abene and Miki. She had counted on getting out of this and collecting her fee.

Abene let out a breath in frustration and anger. But she said, “Can we use that on Gerth, do you think? Tell her that GrayCris tried to kill her and Wilken as well, that they should testify to what happened. Or use Wilken as a hostage…” She shook her head, biting her lip.

She was thinking strategically, which is always a relief, and asking me questions instead of giving me stupid orders. I didn’t have to obey orders anymore, but that doesn’t make them any less annoying. I said, “Our only advantage right now is that Gerth doesn’t know Wilken was compromised.”

The drone was still reporting no activity from the hatches, which meant the bots had gone the other direction, or were working on the lifts. I told it to come to my position. (When it reached Wilken, I had it stop and hover in front of her face for twenty-six seconds. Okay, so I was a little angry.)

Abene was looking at me again. I could see her doing it from the view through Miki’s camera. She said, “Gerth must be waiting for a sign from Wilken before she acts against the others on the shuttle, surely. I should try to contact Kader. I can get a tight feed connection with him.”

“Are you sure he won’t say aloud, ‘Hey everybody, Don Abene’s just signaled me on the feed’ before you can tell him not to?” That’s a problem with humans.

Abene started to speak, hesitated, and then shook her head once. “He might, he might. But we must find out what is happening aboard the shuttle.”

Miki said, “Vibol doesn’t speak very fast. Maybe we should call her.”

I sent Abene and Miki a warning in the feed right before the drone passed us in silent mode; I was sending it ahead to scout. Abene still flinched, then stared after it. But she was right about the shuttle. If we could get a report from onboard, it would help us plan. Also, Abene and Miki would stop asking me about it, which would be a very big bonus right now. (I’d forgotten how stressful being a SecUnit was.) I said, “You don’t have any security monitoring aboard your shuttle? No cameras? No other bots, even a currently inactive one?”

“No.” Abene pushed her hair back, frustrated but thinking. “There’s no need. There are cameras in the evac suit helmets, but they’re inactive in the emergency lockers.”

Miki said, “Don Abene, there are two evac suits on the flight deck. I have the hard addresses for their comms.”

Abene turned to me. “Can you activate their comms from here?”

I probably could. But whether Gerth had killed the others yet, or was still waiting for a signal from Wilken, it didn’t matter. We still needed to get Gerth off the shuttle.

We needed to get everyone off the shuttle.

I was getting an idea. It was probably a bad idea. (When most of your training in tactical thinking comes from adventure shows, that does tend to happen.) I said, “We need to get back to the geo pod.”

Now that I knew where we were going, it was a lot easier to get there. We went to the next lift junction, and I spent a careful minute cutting my code-protected lift out of the system and making its actions invisible to the rest of the lifts. (That sounds like an obvious thing to do, but the problem is, if the other lifts can’t see your lift, they can attempt to occupy the space your lift is already in. This is just as catastrophic for the occupants as it sounds.) 

I sent my drone on the lift first, just to make sure there was nobody waiting for us outside the geo pod, then I took Miki, Abene, and Hirune through. We reached the geo pod hub, walking in under the transparent dome with the shifting storm clouds overhead. I sealed and code-locked the hatches, which admittedly was just to make the humans feel better. The combat bots could blast their way through if they tried hard enough, especially with three of them concentrating on one hatch. I was hoping they were planning to trap us on the route to the shuttle, which was not a great scenario either, but would at least buy us some time. I sent the drone to scout the access corridors that led to the shuttle to see if it could locate the bots’ ambush point.

(I didn’t think the bots would use the lifts even if they got control of the system again, since they would be alert for the kinds of things SecUnits can do. But I told my invisible lift pod to careen randomly around the facility anyway. It was worth a shot.)

Anyway, Step One to getting us back in the shuttle was getting Gerth out of it.

It occurred to me I could do this faster if I had help. Miki had put a semi-conscious Hirune down in one of the padded console chairs while Abene pulled the emergency kit off her harness and rifled through it. I said, “I’m going to try to get a feed connection to your shuttle via the suit comms on the flight deck, but I need to get this control station active. There are diggers still attached to the facility that we might be able to use against the combat bots.” That wasn’t exactly what I was going to do with the diggers, but I didn’t want to argue about it.

Abene nodded understanding and put the med tabs for concussion and shock into Miki’s good hand. “Miki, please take care of Hirune while I work on the control station.” Then she frowned at me and said, “You’re bleeding.”

I looked down. I was dripping onto the floor, a mix of blood and fluid. I hate it when I leak. My veins seal automatically and some of the shrapnel had popped out, but the projectile in my side had moved around, reopening that wound. I cautiously dialed up my pain sensors to check; oh yeah, that’s what had happened. Ouch.

Abene said, “Were you hit?” She stepped toward me, reaching to push my jacket aside.

I jerked back a step. She stopped, startled. Miki turned, its visual sensors focusing in on me. I checked its camera and got a view of my face. I thought I had gotten good at controlling my expression, but apparently only when I wasn’t feeling actual emotions. In our feed connection, Miki said, Abene won’t hurt you, SecUnit.

Abene held up her empty hand, palm out in a gesture that usually meant “don’t shoot me,” except she wasn’t afraid. She was matter-of-fact. She said, “I’m sorry, but you need treatment. Will it be better if Miki helps you?”

I said, “I don’t—” and stopped there because I didn’t have any way to finish that sentence. I needed help, I didn’t want anyone to touch me. These were two mutually exclusive states.

Abene waited, watching me. Then she said, “Miki, can you leave Hirune?”

“I’m okay,” Hirune rasped. She was blinking and clutching a bulb of hydrating solution from the emergency kit. “I’m fine.”

Abene said, “Good. I’ll work on the console and Miki, you come here and help Rin.” Still watching me, she held out the emergency kit and Miki came to take it.

As Abene went to the console, Miki said, “Please lift your left arm and pull your shirt up, SecUnit.”

I had to set down Wilken’s projectile weapon and harness to do that. I did, putting them on the station chair behind me, because it would look like a normal SecUnit thing to do, because I needed to look normal now. I was devoting a lot of attention to the response I needed to make to Abene. I decided a simple error correcting statement was best. “I’m not Rin. Rin is—”

Abene was powering up the digger control station. Not looking at me, studying the console’s interface in the feed, she said, “Consultant Rin is your supervisor, yes, I’m sorry.”

Miki scanned me and sent the results to my feed. Wow, those were kind of big chunks of metal stuck in me. Miki extended a secondary clamp out of its chest and used that to hold the emergency kit as it got the extractor probe out with its good hand. I don’t need the nerve-block, I told Miki on the feed. I can turn my pain sensors down.

That must be handy. Miki poked the probe into the wound in my side. I don’t have pain sensors, but then, I don’t have pain.

Yeah, one of the differences between bots and SecUnits. I had talked to ART about the other differences, once. How we couldn’t trust each other, because of the orders humans could give. And ART had said, There are no humans here.

Well, there were humans here. I said, Miki, did you tell Don Abene that there is no Consultant Rin, there’s just me?

Yes, Miki said. It found the projectile and carefully eased it out. I told her when the first combat bot attacked Wilken, when she asked me if I knew if you were telling the truth. Then it added, I told her because I wanted to, not because I had to.

I was sure Miki believed that. Why does she think I lied about it?

She thinks it’s because it’s illegal in the jurisdictions that GoodNightLander Independent operates in to employ SecUnits. Miki finished applying the wound sealant patch and went for the second projectile. She said someone who works for GoodNightLander Independent must have sent you here but doesn’t want us to know who they are. She said it didn’t matter, since they sent you to help us.

Abene was using the console to boot the interfaces for each digger. I needed to start trying to get intel on the shuttle.

It was tricky since I wanted to keep Abene and Miki’s comm and feed connections cut off so Gerth or anything else that might be wandering the facility with murderous intent couldn’t use them to trace us. But it helped that Miki had the hard addresses for the two suits on the flight deck. The shuttle’s feed was still active, and I was able to sneak in and ping the first suit. After some poking, I got it to activate its comm.

I heard Kader first, asking for a report on Ejiro’s condition. Brais answered, saying the MedSystem had put Ejiro into recovery. Vibol said something in the background that the audio couldn’t quite pick up. Then I heard Gerth say, “Any response from the station yet?”

Sounding frustrated, Kader replied, “Not yet. It’s got to be interference from that storm.”

Vibol spoke again, still too muffled. Gerth answered, “No, we need to sit tight until we hear from them.”

Uh-huh. She sounded calm and confident and reassuring, though I was pretty sure a voice analysis would show the tension underneath.

I pulled out of the connection and backburnered it. Abene had the station display set to visible, floating above the console’s surface, showing the control screens for the diggers. She muttered, “There. All the diggers are powering up. It’s going to take a few minutes. I hope you can control them, it looks like their procedures have all been deleted.”

Miki was picking shrapnel out of my back now. I said, “The rest of the team hasn’t been injured and Gerth is still acting as their security. She won’t let them leave the shuttle to look for you. They’re having trouble contacting the station for help.”

Abene looked up, frowning. “What trouble? We were in contact with the station when we arrived. It shouldn’t—” 

I actually lost the rest of it because my drone pinged me with a report. It had reached the decontam room and had the hatch of the shuttle in scan range, and it hadn’t found any sign of the combat bots. I said aloud, “They aren’t there.”

“What?” Abene stood up from the console, alarmed. “Who?”

“The combat bots. The drone didn’t find them on the route to the shuttle.” I was skimming through everything it was sending me, the scans, the visual data, audio. The drone’s scan was a lot better than mine, and it had been actively searching the route, checking spots for potential ambush. Comparing it to the schematic, I couldn’t see anything it had missed. “They aren’t there.” I sent the drone’s visual into our closed feed connection.

Miki’s head cocked as it reviewed the video. Abene threw a worried look at Hirune. She said, “Then they must be here, near this pod, trying to trap us.”

Maybe. I found my careening invisible lift pod, told it to go to the nearest lift junction to the drone, and ordered the drone to take the lift to the junction outside the geo pod. Within a minute the drone was in the access corridors outside the hatches I had sealed, scanning. I watched it record empty corridors and junctions. Nothing. The bots weren’t setting up an ambush for us on the way to the shuttle and they weren’t outside the geo pod.

My potential strategy hadn’t experienced a catastrophic failure or anything, but I was missing something.

Right, this wasn’t a good time to panic. I went back to my first contact with the drone, the intel I’d gotten before it had been locked out of the combat bots’ network. There was the entry for that third active combat bot. It was marked “active out of range.”

I had assumed it was out of range because it was headed toward where the shuttle was docked, to set up a trap for us when we tried to retreat, but I didn’t know that.

Go back further. Wilken and Gerth had been sent here in place of the contracted GI security to stop/kill the assessment team. So why hadn’t they acted as soon as they arrived on the transit station? With so few people there, it wouldn’t have been difficult. They would have needed an exit scenario if they had acted on the station, but they needed an exit scenario even more here on the facility. The team’s shuttle wasn’t wormhole capable. They would have to return to the transit station, kill the PA staff who would possibly be asking a lot of questions about what had happened to the rest of the assessment team, and steal a wormhole capable ship. (Preferably a ship without a bot pilot who would vigorously resist being stolen.) That sounded like a lot of work, especially considering the fact that there were combat bots on the facility, ready to destroy intruders, so why had GrayCris hired someone else?

The obvious answer was that Wilken and Gerth weren’t here to kill the team, but wanted to get into the terraforming facility because there was something, either data or a physical object, that they intended to retrieve. But they had made no move to retrieve anything. I was certain Wilken had been surprised by the combat bot attack, my analysis there was not faulty. Had Wilken and Gerth even been sent by GrayCris, or was there another corporate or political entity in play?

I needed help. I was rattled, I was still leaking a little, and I hadn’t been able to watch any media in what felt like forever. In desperation, I copied all my possibilities into a potential strategy/decision tree diagram and threw it into the feed for Abene and Miki.

Abene winced, startled at the sudden large image in her feed. Then her face went still as she studied the diagram. Miki wiped wound sealant onto the last shrapnel laceration in my back and shifted into analysis mode. Hirune, still half conscious, watched us with a confused expression.

In the feed, Abene detached one of the assumption squares and moved it away from the tree. She said, If we assume Wilken and Gerth were sent by GrayCris, then they aren’t here to retrieve anything. GrayCris had ample opportunity to remove anything they wanted when they abandoned the facility. She hesitated, her attention moving from one assumption square to another. I think we have to ask ourselves, what does GrayCris want?

That was easy. I said, To destroy the facility. If GoodNightLander Independent hadn’t installed the tractor array, the facility would have collapsed into the planet by now.

Abene’s brow furrowed as she looked at the squares listing possible exit scenarios and the problems with each one. So why weren’t Wilken and Gerth sent to destroy the tractor array? Actually, perhaps they were.

Miki said, aloud, “Wilken altered the flat display on her right forearm armor to show local facility time.” It sent us an image in the feed: Wilken adjusting the display on her armor. The image had been captured when I asked Miki to look at the two security consultants as they stowed their equipment when the shuttle was getting ready to undock from the transit station. “She checked that display approximately fifty-seven times during our walk through the facility, until she attempted to hurt Don Abene.”

I hadn’t noticed that, but when I reran a portion of my video, there it was. Abene said slowly, “Wilken knew something would happen to the facility, and approximately when it would happen. She could only wait so long before she had to get back to the shuttle. When she had the opportunity, she sent you off to be killed by the combat bots, and intended to kill me and Miki. Then she would tell the others it was hopeless and force them to return to the transit station—”

The combat bots’ behavior was starting to make sense. If they had been waiting for something, too, it explained why they had taken Hirune prisoner. They had assigned one bot to mess with us. To attack, grab a prisoner, retreat, attack again. I had destroyed it when it attacked Wilken, but the other three hadn’t come rushing after us. Two had been in the engineering pod, and one was out of range, doing what?

Abene took a sharp breath. She said, “It has to be the tractor array. There’s no other real benefit for GrayCris.” In the feed, she flicked away the assumption squares for the actions of a theoretical station-bound GrayCris operative. “We know from the drone there is no controller for the combat bots, no one aboard the transit station sending orders to them. They are original equipment, meant to defend the facility until it collapsed naturally into the planet, leaving no evidence that it was an illegal mining operation. Wilken and Gerth didn’t know about the bots and weren’t sent to kill us, because killing us is not the goal. The goal is to let the facility be destroyed as planned. The thing that prevents the facility being destroyed is the tractor array. Therefore Wilken and Gerth were sent here to do something, and they thought the only consequence of that something was that the tractor array would fail, and we would be forced to leave the facility. We would all return to the transit station and they would leave aboard the next cargo ship, with no one the wiser.” She slipped out of the feed and turned to me. “But what could they have done? They were with us the whole time.”

I thought she was right, and there was only one thing they could have done without me or someone in the team noticing. “They sent an encrypted signal.” A comm signal, not a feed signal. With all the storm interference, and more importantly the fact that I hadn’t been looking for it, I had missed it.

“Yes, yes.” Abene’s brows lifted. “But to who? The combat bots? Is there a weapon, a way for the bots to destroy the array from here?” She turned to look at the other consoles. 

I checked my connection to the shuttle’s audio again. Kader was pushing Gerth about trying to go aboard the facility to search for the others, backed up by Brais and Vibol. No mention of any problem with the tractor array. They had to be monitoring it. Gerth was pushing back, saying they had to wait like they agreed. I ran the audio back. She wanted them to wait thirty minutes. The digger display sent a ping into the feed, indicating that the diggers had finished their full power-up. I sent the shuttle audio into the feed for Abene and Miki and sat down at the digger control station. Whatever was going to happen, it was going to be soon.

As I sent the first set of orders for three of the diggers, Abene said to Miki, “We need sensors. Check all the consoles. Anything in here will be pointed at the surface, but we can try to redirect—”

I backburnered everything but the diggers. Abene was obviously still interested in saving the facility, but my priority was in getting off the facility before it broke up in the atmosphere.

The three diggers uncoiled out of their housings and started to walk across the outside of the lower half of the geo pod. Their multiple arms gripped the surface securely as they moved, the cameras giving me a dizzying view of the storm. They didn’t have the memory cores with their mining protocols, but then they wouldn’t need them for what I wanted them to do.

Abene had booted another console and data popped up above the display surface as Miki leaned over it. Hirune shoved to her feet and limped over to them, leaning on the back of a chair.

I needed to copy over some specialized code from the console, but once I had it, I could control the three diggers through the feed. I assigned them yet another channel in my overworked brain, and stood up. Oh, okay, ouch. Without their protocols, controlling them was tricky. I basically had to drive all three of them at once. Keeping my voice level and patient, I said, “We need to go. You have six minutes.”

Abene waved a hand. “We’ve almost got it.”

I reminded myself I was still pretending to be a SecUnit under contract, and put the countdown in the feed with no additional commentary. Then I collected Wilken’s weapon and harness and went to stand by the hatch.

Hirune looked around, picked up the emergency kit from where Miki had left it, and limped over to stand beside me. She was unsteady on her feet and still clearly a little out of it, but having been carried off by a combat bot once, she was obviously ready to call it a day.

Abene pushed to her feet. “Yes, there! Copy that trajectory, Miki.” Miki acknowledged and followed Abene as she strode to the doorway. “Some sort of structure launched from the engineering pod and is heading toward the tractor array. The missing combat bot must be aboard it, and it means to destroy the array. Those orders must have been in the encrypted transmission Wilken and Gerth sent.”

That’s great! And I will care about the fucking tractor array once I get us on the fucking shuttle! Watching my own countdown, I pulled three inputs forward, my drone, Miki, and the diggers. No wait, I needed my own camera, too. Four inputs. Oh, and the suit audio from the shuttle. Five inputs. I had the drone do a quick check of the foyer and the access to the lift junction, making sure it was clear. I said, “We need to move fast. We don’t know where the other combat bots are.”

Abene nodded and gripped Hirune’s arm. Hirune whispered, “Where are we going?”

Abene shushed her. “Back to the shuttle. It’s all right.” Miki patted Hirune’s shoulder.

I hit the release for the hatch and stepped out. The fast walk to the lift junction made every nerve in my human skin itch. The drone scouted ahead of us, scanning, but I irrationally expected the bots to leap out from around the next corner.

We reached the junction and I sent the drone ahead in my invisible lift. Abene and Miki talked on the feed, occasionally making a reassuring comment to Hirune. They could be plotting to sell me for parts and I couldn’t spare the attention to listen in. Outside the diggers neared the curve of the geo pod. They would need to follow the trough between it and the habitation pod to avoid being spotted by the shuttle.

The lift reached the junction nearest our docking area and the drone zipped out. I sent it on a quick scouting pattern, up and down the access and through into the decontam room, then up to get a view of the shuttle’s lock. The scan was clear, and I told the drone to return to the lift junction and hold position.

The lift returned and I got the humans inside. (And Miki, but at the moment I was classing it with the humans.) I directed the diggers to speed up a little. I wanted us to spend as little time in the access corridor to the shuttle as possible. If the combat bots decided we were putting their mission at risk, they’d come after us and they knew they could catch us there. As I started the lift, I sent Abene the diggers’ video so she’d have some idea of what the shuttle was about to see, and told her, “When I unlock your feed, connect to Kader and tell him to make sure to get everyone off the shuttle.”

“I will.” She nodded sharply and squeezed Hirune’s hand, and tapped Miki’s feed.

The lift reached the junction and I was out as soon as the doors slid open. I moved toward the decontam room, the humans behind me, and I sent the diggers over the curve of the habitation pod and straight in toward the shuttle.

On board, through my connection to the evac suits on the flight deck, I heard Vibol say something in a language I didn’t have loaded, and Kader say, “We’ve got something approaching, unknowns are approaching—”

Distantly, from somewhere below the flight deck, Gerth shouted, “What? What direction?”

I opened Abene’s feed connection, and told her, Now.

She made the private connection to Kader and said, Kader, listen. No questions, don’t tell anyone I’m here. You must get everyone off the shuttle into the facility now, at once. Do whatever you must, pretend to be in a panic, but get everyone off. Your lives depend on it.

Through Abene’s feed, I heard Kader trigger an emergency evacuate order that blared across the team’s feed and the shuttle comms. Gerth had started up to the flight deck and snarled, “Stop, stop where—”

I thought she might trap Kader and Vibol in the cockpit, and we’d be back to a hostage situation. But Kader, who must have taken the “pretend to panic” advice to heart, sent the vid of the approaching diggers from the shuttle’s sensors into the feed and screamed for the others to get out.

I reached the corridor and had a view of the docking chamber as the shuttle’s hatch cycled open. Brais staggered out, a semi-conscious Ejiro leaning on her. Miki ran to help them, Abene hanging back with Hirune, and I followed.

I told one digger to let go of the facility’s surface and dive at the shuttle’s nose, where the forward sensor would have the best view. Abene was in Kader’s feed but with no cameras I got nothing but a confused jumble of impressions.

(I found out later from Gerth’s armor cam that the sudden sensor view of something large coming at the shuttle had made Gerth jerk backward out of the flight deck access. Vibol, taking Kader’s performance as evidence that the shuttle was about to be torn apart, grabbed Kader and dove past Gerth with him tucked under her arm, using the lighter gravity in the access to keep from slamming into the bulkhead. When they hit the corridor floor, they stumbled in the heavier gravity, staggered, and bolted for the hatch.) 

Anyway, Kader and Vibol flung themselves out of the hatch, and Gerth, in her powered armor, strode out after them. I was standing to one side of the shuttle hatch by that point, so all Gerth saw was the others, confused and panicked, with Abene and Hirune, and a one-handed Miki holding up Ejiro.

I scanned her armor and found the right code. (It was a much quicker process now that I knew where to look.) Just as she brought her projectile weapon up, I sent the command.

Her armor froze in place, and I stepped around into view. Her expression as she realized what had happened was gratifying. If she had been using her scan, she would have detected me just outside the hatch, but even with the feed, even augmented, humans can only think about one thing at a time.

Abene said, “Now we must get back on the shuttle!”

The others demanded answers and she explained rapidly as she shooed them toward the hatch. I tuned it out to check on all my other inputs. Without my orders, the diggers had gone dormant and stopped where they were. Two were still on the surface of the habitation pod, and the one that had lifted off to dive at the shuttle had landed on the atmosphere pod. Then I checked the drone, which I had left in the lift junction to watch our backs.

It started to respond with a scan of the area, then the transmission cut off abruptly. I felt the connection drop, the drone going out like a light.

I said, “Abene, Miki, bots!” I crossed the room, pulling Wilken’s projectile weapon off my back.

Abene yelled, “Aboard, now!”

I reached the doorway and started to pull explosive packs off Wilken’s harness, arm them, and toss them down the corridor. I still had Miki’s camera as an input and I backburnered it, but I was peripherally aware of the humans scrambling, getting the wounded Ejiro and Hirune through the lock, and Abene telling Miki to pick up Gerth and carry her in. It was about that time when the combat bot slammed around the corner and the first explosive charge went off.

I fired three projectiles, just to make it think I was going to stand here like an idiot and shoot at it, then sprinted back across the room. The charges in the corridor delayed the bot long enough for the humans and Miki to get Gerth in and clear the lock. I flung myself through and I hit the emergency close. Both hatches slammed down.

Finally, I had gotten these fucking people back on this fucking shuttle.

The combat bot hit the outer hatch with an impact like we had been rammed by another small shuttle. I sent to Abene, We need to go.

The clamps gave way and the shuttle fell away from the lock. I checked the camera view of the outer hatch and saw the combat bot standing in the open docking port, holding onto the sides as the chamber decompressed. There was a second one behind it. Miki stood beside me, and I shared the image with it on our feed connection. It said, “Those bots were mean, SecUnit.”

I was losing the connection with distance but one of my diggers was close enough to the lock, crouched in sleep mode. I sent it a last order and it whipped its big hand down, snatched the first bot out of the port, and crushed it.

“Ouch,” Miki commented. SecUnit, why don’t you talk to me on the feed anymore?

Miki knew why, or it wouldn’t have asked.

I stepped around it and went down the access corridor. Miki said in the feed, I didn’t tell on you until I had to.

I went up the corridor toward the crew area. Miki picked up Gerth and followed. In the comm audio, I had been monitoring Abene while she gave the others the quick version of what had happened with Wilken, how I had saved Hirune, how Wilken had shot Miki’s poor hand off, how I had saved her and Miki, and so on, whatever. I had my geo pod data for Dr. Mensah, I had saved Miki’s stupid humans, I just wanted to get out of here. The shuttle was moving away from the facility and I could feel the transit station’s feed just on the edge of my range.

I stepped into the crew area. Kader and Vibol were up in the cockpit, but the others were here, though Ejiro and Hirune were collapsed into seats. Ejiro looked woozy but more alert than Hirune, who probably needed to be stuffed into the MedSystem. Miki set Gerth on her feet, and everyone stared at her for a second, then at me.

Brais stood, facing the floating display. It showed a sensor view of the tractor array above the facility. “Yes, there it is. The object is heading toward the tractor array.”

Abene looked grim. “We think it’s a work zipper from the engineering pod. One of the combat bots is aboard.”

I said, “Don Abene, we need to return to the transit station as soon as possible. When the tractor array fails, it could damage the shuttle.” I guess it could. I don’t know, it sounded good.

In my feed, Miki said, I never talked to a bot like me before. I have human friends, but I never had a friend like me.

I had to bite my cheek to keep my expression at SecUnit neutral. I wanted to block Miki’s feed, but I needed to keep monitoring it in case the humans started plotting against me. (I know, it sounds paranoid. But Miki and Abene knew I’d made Consultant Rin up, and I needed to get away before they told that to a human who knew just how not normal that behavior was for a SecUnit.)

On the comm from the flight deck, Kader said, “We’ve got to commit in the next minute, are you sure about this?”

Wait, what? I ran back my recording and listened to Brais say, “We can use the shuttle to knock the zipper off course. Our shielding will protect our hull—”

Squinting at the display, Ejiro said, “But wouldn’t the zipper be able to return and try again?”

Brais shook her head, still watching the flight projection. “I’ve pulled the specs on that model of zipper. It’s meant for facility maintenance and needs a feed connection to the engineering pod to operate. We can push it out of range and it’ll lose navigation control.”

Oh, great. How long was that going to take?

By the time I caught up to realtime, they had already decided to do it, they were just arguing about specifics.

I stood there watching the glowing shapes on the display as Kader took the shuttle closer to the zipper. I admit, I did watch a little more of the episode I had paused while this was going on. (It was only six minutes, but it was a boring six minutes, okay? Also, Miki had walked over to stand sadly next to Abene and stare at me, and I was ignoring it. Abene thought Miki was sad about the missing hand, and kept patting it and telling it they would get it fixed as soon as they got back to the station.)

(It’s a good thing I don’t have a stomach and can’t vomit.)

Finally the shuttle bumped the zipper off its course, dramatically saving the tractor array and GoodNightLander Independent’s investment with forty-five seconds to spare, yay. The humans congratulated each other, and Abene and Brais helped Hirune stand so they could take her to the medical unit. There was still one combat bot left on the facility, but that sounded like somebody else’s problem. The shuttle had altered course to head back to the station and we were close enough already for me to ping Ship through the feed. It pinged back, still waiting for me. That was a relief.

And I heard a clank from the hatch.

I’m not an expert on space, but I was pretty sure stuff wasn’t supposed to knock on the hatch. It might have been debris from the zipper, but I knew. I just knew it wasn’t. I checked the hatch camera, and got a wide-angle view of combat bot face.

The next connection overrode the station feed, temporarily blotting out all my channels: [Objective: kill intruders.] 

Oh, shit.

I blocked the bot out of my feed and yelled, “Emergency! Lock breach imminent!” I sent the images from the hatch camera to Miki and through it into the rest of the team’s feed. The humans froze and it felt like forever, it felt like they weren’t going to believe me. But I had forgotten how slow humans seemed to move when I actually had all my attention on what I was doing. Kader hit the all-ship alarm and sealed the two interior hatches between the lock and the crew area. Great, that would buy me a minute, maybe two.

I told Abene, “Get everyone into the flight deck.” There was another hatch there and it might buy another minute. I turned for the access to the compartment just below us where Gerth and Wilken had stored their gear.

As I climbed out of the access I heard Abene yelling, “Go, go,” and I knew from the team feed that the shuttle was heading toward the station and Vibol was tersely explaining to the Port Authority that we were about to be torn apart by a combat bot.

(Frankly, I didn’t know what station security was going to do about it, either. In fact, I’m sure station security was now shitting itself almost as hard as I metaphorically was.)

The hatch camera helpfully showed me the outer hatch being punched apart, then the feed fizzled and died. The bot would be working on the first inner hatch now. I reached the compartment and saw that Wilken and Gerth had left one case beside the empty ones that had held their armor, the large projectile weapons, explosive packs, and ammo. I tore the remaining case open and found another set of small charges, the kind used more for getting through security doors and hatches. There was a bag that felt empty when I grabbed it and I used it to scoop up the charges and some extra ammo for the projectile weapon I had across my back. It wasn’t going to be that helpful since I doubted I’d have time to use it. Maybe I should have spent the time trying to set up a position instead of coming down here hoping for a decent bot-busting weapon. In the bot-fighting business, small mistakes like that get you torn apart.

In the feed, I heard Abene and Brais handing Hirune up the access to the cockpit. They had already got Ejiro up there. In my feed, Miki said, Hurry, hurry. Abene had told it to bring Gerth and it was holding her. The combat bot pounded on the hatch to the crew area. I shoved upright, turned, and that’s when I saw the assessment team’s equipment storage.

There were cases and racks of environmental testing and sampling tools. One was a core cutter, made to take nice round cylinders out of walls of rock for whatever reason humans need to do that. It was an extension meant to attach to a sampler unit, but they probably had it because Miki was strong enough to lift it and use it; it’s a long tube that uses directed explosive cutters to extract meter-length sections.

I slung the ammo bag over my back, grabbed the cutter off the rack, switched on its power pack, and climbed up the access.

I stepped back into the crew area just as Miki flung Gerth after Abene and hit the manual seal for the hatch. It dropped and Miki turned. I told it, Miki, get out of here! Go hide in the cargo!

No, Rin, it said, I’m going to help you!

In the feed, Abene yelled at Miki to come in with them, she would tell Kader to open the hatch if it would just come in—and Miki told her, Priority is to protect my friends.

Priority change, Abene sent. Priority is to protect yourself.

That priority change is rejected, Miki told her.

The core cutter had powered up and accessed my feed to deliver a canned warning and a handy set of directions. Why yes, I did want to disengage the safety protocols, thanks for asking.

I’d meant to give the core cutter to Miki so it could get the combat bot while I distracted it. But the combat bot blew the hatch and was suddenly in the crew area with us, and there was no time for a plan, no time for strategy.

The bot knew I was there and it turned, reaching for me as I lifted the cutter. Miki braced its feet against the hatch protecting the flight deck access and pushed off. It launched across the cabin, its body cutting through the floating display, straight at the combat bot’s head. I don’t know if Miki was trying to distract the combat bot, or if it had seen me make a similar attack on the bot that came after Wilken, and was trying to duplicate the technique. Air rushed out of the pressurized cabin, down the access corridor and out the ruined airlock, and as Miki jumped the flow gave it an extra boost of speed.

The bot caught the motion and turned away from me, lifted up and extended an arm to catch Miki by the torso. I took the opening and lunged in to slam the core cutter right against the bot’s side, where its brain was. I triggered the cutter. I didn’t have time to brace myself, and the recoil knocked me backward and for three seconds my vision went black.

I was flat on the deck, and all I could hear in the feed was humans yelling from the cockpit, humans yelling over the comm from the Port Authority, and the shuttle’s emergency siren making sure everyone knew the air had just explosively vacated due to lock breaches. The core cutter was on top of me and I pushed it off and sat up. I knew at some point I had heard Abene scream in anguish, but I wasn’t sure when it had happened.

The combat bot still stood, but it was unmoving, joints frozen. The core cutter had gone through its torso from one side to the other and extracted a neat cross-section of the protective shielding and the bot’s processors. The core had been ejected from the back of the cutter and had fallen to the deck. I realized that was what had hit me in the head. I guess despite the instructions I had been holding it wrong.

Miki was crumpled in front of the bot, and something looked wrong. I was climbing to my feet, trying to see how Miki was damaged, when I froze. Something looked wrong because Miki’s chest was crushed, its processor, memory, everything that made it Miki squeezed to nothing in one flex of the combat bot’s hand.

I just sat on the deck. The shuttle neared the station, and the humans were on the comm, talking to the PA from the cockpit. They couldn’t lower the flight deck hatch because of the lock breaches, and I hadn’t answered their attempts to call me on feed or comm. I had still been sending visuals from my camera to the team feed, and they had seen the fight and Miki’s last moment from my point of view. Before I cut my feed connection to them, I’d heard Abene sobbing, Hirune trying to comfort her, the others murmuring in shock.

I need air, too, though not nearly as much as humans, and maybe the lack of it was what made me feel so slow and disconnected. I used the station feed to ping Ship again and told it to unlock from the station, and I gave it a rendezvous position. Its calm acknowledgement felt strange, like everything was normal and nothing disastrous had happened.

Vibol knocked on the other side of the flight deck hatch, calling, “SecUnit, are you there? Please answer!”

I needed to get out of here. I shoved to my feet and went down the corridor to the emergency suit locker. I put on a full evac suit with maneuvering jets and the burst of air once I got the helmet sealed made me feel more alert. I made sure to leave the locker open and unclamp the other suits, so when anyone noticed one was missing, they would assume it had happened during the attack and the suit had been drawn out with the other debris. I wanted them to think that that was what had happened to me, that I had been sucked out of the lock in pieces. Then I went down the corridor to the ruined lock, pulled myself out and away.

I hadn’t used a suit like this before (they don’t generally let murderbots float around in space unsupervised) but the internal instruction feed was very helpful. By the time Ship arrived, I was able to jet into its airlock like a pro. 

To the station, it would have looked like Ship had paused to let the shuttle get past so it could safely dock at the PA’s slot. I didn’t think anybody would be looking at the sensors for escaping SecUnits in evac suits.

Once I’d cycled through the lock and had Ship crank up its air system a little, I told it to proceed on its usual course for the wormhole and HaveRatton Station. I got the suit off, dumped it aside with Wilken’s weapon and the ammo bag I had grabbed out of the case. I sat down on the deck and started methodically checking all the equipment to make sure there were no tracers.

Abene had tried to change Miki’s priority to saving its own life, and it had refused her. Which meant she had allowed its programming that option, that ability to use its own judgment in a crisis situation. It had decided its priority was to save its humans, and maybe to save me, too. Or maybe it had known it couldn’t save any of us, but it had wanted to give me the chance to try. Or it hadn’t wanted me to face the bot alone. Whatever it was, I’d never know.

What I did know was that Abene really had loved Miki. That hurt in all kinds of ways. Miki could never be my friend, but it had been her friend, and more importantly, she had been its friend. Her gut reaction in a moment of crisis was to tell Miki to save itself.

After I checked the charges and ammo in the bag, I found a fake pocket in the bottom. Inside it were several sets of identity markers and a larger, different brand of memory clip from the ones I had stored in my arm. I heaved myself upright, and found a reader in the cargo console.

Well, that was interesting.

I hate caring about stuff. But apparently once you start, you can’t just stop.

I wasn’t going to just send the geo pod data to Dr. Mensah. I was taking it to her personally. I was going back.

Then I laid down on the floor and started Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon from episode one.

When I got back to HaveRatton Station, a bunch of humans tried to kill me. Considering how much I’d been thinking about killing a bunch of humans, it was only fair.

Ship was on approach and I was waiting impatiently to pick up HaveRatton’s feed. Since Ship was a minimum capacity bot pilot and had all the brains and personality of a heat shield generator, I was also monitoring all its inputs and caught the navigation alert when it came in. (I knew Ship wouldn’t betray me intentionally, but the chance of it doing so unintentionally was resting at a solid 84 percent.)

The alert was from HaveRatton’s Port Authority, and ordered Ship to divert away from its usual slot in the private commercial docks to another section at the end of the public passenger embarkation zone.

I still had the schematic of HaveRatton from when I had boarded Ship here on the way to Milu. I could see that section of the embarkation zone was right next to the PA’s docks, where the deployment point for the station’s security response team was.

Oh, that’s not suspicious at all.

Was it about me? Maybe, probably? Ship had carried Wilken and Gerth, who had been sent to sabotage GoodNightLander Independent’s attempt to reclaim GrayCris’ abandoned terraforming facility, so it might be about them. Wilken and/or Gerth were hopefully being held by GI somewhere now, and GI might have requested HaveRatton do a routine search for evidence.

It didn’t matter. If there was anybody waiting for Ship, I couldn’t be aboard when it docked.

I could direct Ship to a different dock but that wasn’t a great idea. The PA would not only know someone aboard had done it, but that that someone was riding a bot-piloted cargo transport whose feed manifest said it was currently traveling without crew or passengers and was on minimal life-support. Even stations as big and heavily armed as HaveRatton had to be careful of anomalous approaches that might turn out to be raiders attempting to board. (It would be a stupid attempt, since Ship couldn’t carry enough raiders to do anything but die messily in the embarkation zone, but I’d spent my entire life on security contracts trying to stop humans from similar catastrophic stupidity.) It might worry the station command enough that they would fire on Ship. Ship might be unresponsive but it was doing its best and I didn’t want it hurt.

So it was a good thing I still had the evac suit.

I’d used it to escape Abene’s shuttle after the combat bot attack—another thing that had happened that I wished I could delete from my memory. (Deleting memories like that doesn’t work. I can delete things from my data storage, but not from the organic parts of my head. The company had purged my memory a few times, including my whole mass murder incident, and the images hung around like ghosts in an endless historical family drama serial.)

(I like endless historical family drama serials, but in real life, ghosts are way more annoying.)

Earlier when I was getting ready for station arrival, I had packed the evac suit into a supply locker. I figured since Ship seldom ran passengers along with cargo, it would be a long time before somebody finally noticed it wasn’t on inventory and actually checked its docs and registrations. Now I started unpacking it, fast.

I really didn’t want to get caught.

I stuffed my bag under my jacket and got the suit on and activated. As Ship made its docking maneuver and eased up on the designated slot, I cycled through the cargo module airlock on the opposite side. Ship’s drones gathered to watch me, confused as to why I was going out the wrong door and beeping sadly about it. As Ship locked on to the station, I slipped out the airlock and sent a close and seal request. As I pulled myself along Ship’s outer skin, I deleted the last few bits of me from its memory.

Bye, Ship. You were there when it counted.

If a report of what had happened on Milu had gone out on a faster transport (Ship’s progress was leisurely at best) then it could have easily beat me here. They might know that a SecUnit had come to Milu, saved some humans, failed to save a human form bot, killed the shit out of three combat bots, and that Ship was the only transport who had left Milu right after all that happened.

Me not being aboard when they searched, with no sign of having been there, would obscure the issue somewhat. It’s not like I needed any food or used disposal. I’d used a little extra air and the shower but I’d purged the recycling logs. A forensic sweep might show that I’d been there. If forensic sweeps worked like they did in the entertainment media, which, come to think about it, I had no idea if they did or not.

(Note to self: look up real forensic sweeps.)

I reached the side of the station, doing a physical scan for security cams or drones or whatever while searching for feed and comm signals. Other ships were locked on nearby, but all I could see were hulls and bulky cargo mod ules, no large viewports with humans looking out wondering who that random escaping SecUnit in the suit was. I caught a few signals, but all were either debris detectors or cargo bot guides. I followed the line of magnetic clamps used by the cargo bots to secure modules to the station, and found a bot in the process of removing a module from a large cargo transport. I accessed the bot’s feed channel and checked its work orders. The transport it was currently working on was bot-piloted, crew on leave, passengers disembarked. I asked the cargo bot if I could go inside the transport before it inserted the new empty module. It said sure.

(Humans never think to tell their bots things like, say, don’t respond to random individuals wandering the outside of the station. Bots are instructed to report and repel theft attempts, but no one ever tells them not to answer polite requests from other bots.)

I climbed inside the empty module structure and up to the airlock. I pinged the transport, it pinged back. I didn’t have time to bribe it, so I sent it the official station hauler’s security key I had just pulled from the cargo bot’s memory, and asked it if I could come inside and walk through and out to the dock. It said sure.

I cycled through the lock, took off the evac suit, and found a storage locker to pack it into. At the main airlock, I borrowed the security camera to take a look at myself. I’d removed the blood and fluid from my clothes back on Ship, in the cleaning unit in its passenger restroom, but there hadn’t been anything on board to fix the projectile and shrapnel holes. Fortunately the jacket I was wearing was dark and the holes weren’t that visible, and the shirt collar was just high enough to cover the disabled data port in the back of my neck.

Normally that wasn’t a problem, as most humans had never seen a SecUnit without armor and would assume the port was just an augment. If the humans who had diverted Ship were after me, they probably knew that a SecUnit without armor would look like an augmented human.

(Possibly I was overthinking this. I do that; it’s the anxiety that comes with being a part-organic murderbot. The upside was paranoid attention to detail. The downside was also paranoid attention to detail.)

I made sure I was running the code I’d written to make my walking gait and body language more human, deleted myself out of the transport’s log, and walked out through the main airlock into the station docks.

I was already in the feed, using it to hack into the station’s weapons-scanning drones, telling them to ignore me. It was always important to hack the weapon scanners, since I have two inbuilt energy weapons in my forearms. This time it was more important, because among other things I had an armor-piercing projectile weapon and ammo in my bag. 

It was one of Wilken and Gerth’s weapons that I’d taken when I left Milu. I’d spent some time on the return trip using Ship’s tool suite to take it apart and rebuild it into a more compact form, so it was easier to conceal. So now I was not only a rogue unit, I was a rogue unit carrying a weapon designed to shoot armored security. Which is just playing to the humans’ expectations, I guess.

But fooling the weapons scanners was so much easier now than it had been the first time I’d done it while leaving Port FreeCommerce. Part of it was learning the quirks of the different security systems I was encountering. But what really helped was that all this coding and working with different systems on the fly had opened up some new neural pathways and processing space. I’d noticed it on Milu, when I’d been handling multiple inputs without any Hub or SecSystem assistance, to the point where I thought my brain was going to implode. Hard work really did make you improve; who knew?

Following my map, I left the secure (supposedly secure) dock area and took the walkway toward the station mall. It passed over the end of the public embarkation zone and the PA dock where Ship had been directed.

I had been in crowds of humans enough times by now I shouldn’t panic anymore—I had ridden on a transport with a whole crowd of humans who thought I was an augmented human security consultant and talked at me nonstop nearly the whole time. Except there was a little panic.

I should be over this by now.

Every nerve in the organic parts of me twitched as I blended with a large group of transport passengers. It helps that in stations like this, humans and augmented humans are distracted. Everybody’s a stranger, everybody’s checking the feed for info or communication or entertainment while they’re walking. As the walkway passed in front of Ship’s slot, I spotted a big group down on the embarkation floor. With the rest of the crowd of humans, I turned my head to glance down.

Twenty-three of them in power suits, all heavily armed, forming up for a boarding operation. None were in SecUnit armor, and I wasn’t picking up any pings, so they were probably all human or augmented human. Forty-seven security drones of various sizes and armament circled over their heads in a deployment-ready swarm. I caught a station security drone and had it zoom in on the shoulder logo of a suit. I didn’t recognize it immediately, except for the fact that it wasn’t a HaveRatton station logo. I tagged it for a future image search.

HaveRatton Station Security was there, but they were back at the entrance to the Port Authority zone, watching the boarding operation. So whoever it was had contracted with HaveRatton to bring an armed team in. That’s expensive. And worrying. You don’t need twenty-three humans in power suits and a flotilla of security drones for an evidence search.

Station security had to be using their drones to keep an eye on the security company stamping around on their dock area. I checked my captive StationSec drone’s recording buffer and found nearly an hour of intercepted comm traffic. I downloaded it and ran a query for the word SecUnit. It hit almost immediately.

SecUnit. You think this thing is really onboard?

Intel says possibly. I—

With its controller?

No controller, dim-iot, that’s why they call them rogues.

Oh yeah. It was about me.

On Milu’s terraforming facility/illegal alien remnant mining platform, Wilken and Gerth had recognized me as a SecUnit. It had come in handy at the time, but it wasn’t something I wanted to happen again.

Ever again.

My friend ART had changed my configuration, removing up to a centimeter from my arms and legs so I wouldn’t match a scan for SecUnit standard body shape. ART’s alterations to my code had made parts of me grow sparse, soft, humanlike body hair, and changed the way my skin met the edges of my inorganic parts, so they looked more like augments. It was subtle, something ART thought would lessen human suspicion on a subliminal level. (ART’s pretentious like that.) The change in code had also made my eyebrows and the hair on my head get thicker, and that made my face look far more different than such a slight change should. I didn’t like it, but it was necessary.

But it wasn’t enough of a change to fool humans familiar with SecUnits. (Granted, running up a wall in front of Wilken and Gerth had been a dead giveaway before they even got a real look at me.) I could control my behavior (well, sort of, mostly) but I needed to control my appearance.

So while I was still on Ship, I had used ART’s templates to alter my code temporarily to let the hair on my head grow at an accelerated rate. (Accelerated because if I screwed up and started getting near the bipedal furry media monster end of the spectrum, I’d still have a chance to fix it.) I gave the hair on my head another two centimeters of growth, then stopped it when I hit my target.

To check my results, I’d pulled up an image from my archived video, and found a good view of my face from Dr. Mensah’s camera. I don’t usually use cameras to look at myself because why the hell would I want to do that, but I had been on contract then and still collecting all my clients’ feeds. From the timestamp, the image was from when we’d been standing outside the hoppers, when GrayCris was hunting us, and she had asked me to let the others see my face so they would trust me.

I’d compared that old image with my current image via drone cam. After all the changes, I did look different now, and more human.

I didn’t like it even more.

But now that I was back on HaveRatton with an as yet unidentified security force looking for me, it was coming in handy. The next step was to get rid of my clothing and its obvious projectile holes. At the edge of the station mall, I forced myself to walk into one of the big travelers’ supply places.

I had used station vending machines to buy memory clips, but I had never been in an actual shop before. Even though the vending was all automated, and I sort of knew what to do based on what I had seen on the entertainment feed, it was still weird. (And by weird I mean an agonizing level of anxiety.) Fortunately there are apparently humans as clueless as I was because as soon as I crossed the threshold the shop’s feed immediately sent me an interactive instruction module.

It guided me to one of the empty vending booths, which was completely enclosed. Telling it to shut the privacy door was such a relief my performance reliability percentage went up half a point. The booth scanned my hard currency card and then offered a set of menus.

I picked the one that was labeled as basic, practical, and comfortable for travel. I hesitated over long skirts, wide pants, full-length caftans, and tunics and jackets that went to the knees. The idea of combining them all, and having a lot of clothing as a buffer between me and the outside world, was attractive, but I wasn’t used to it and I was afraid that would show. (It had taken me long enough to figure out what to do with my arms and hands while walking and standing still; extra clothing meant that much more potential for attention-drawing mistakes.) The scarves and hats and other head and face coverings, some of which had human cultural functions, were also tempting, but it was exactly the kind of thing a SecUnit trying to hide might use, and would just flag me for additional security scans.

I’d worn two different sets of human clothes by now, so I had a better idea of what was most efficient for me. I picked workboots not much different from the ones I’d stolen back on Port FreeCommerce, self-sizing and with some shielding to protect against heavy things dropping on them, not as important for me as a human. Then pants with lots of sealable pockets, a long-sleeved shirt with a collar to cover my data port, and another soft hooded jacket. Okay, so it was extremely similar to what I had been wearing, just in a different arrangement of black and dark blue. I authorized the payment, and the packets dropped out of the slot. 

When I put the new clothes on, I had a strange feeling I usually associated with finding a new show on the entertainment feed that looked good. I “liked” these clothes. Maybe I actually liked them enough to remove the quotation marks around “liked.” I don’t like things in general that can’t be downloaded via the entertainment feed.

Maybe because I’d picked them myself.

Maybe.

I got a replacement knapsack, too, a better one with more sealable pockets. I dressed, got a discount because I was willing to dump my old clothes into the shop’s recycler, and left the booth.

Back out in the station mall, blending with the crowd, I started downloading new entertainment media and transport schedules, and started a feed search for news reports. My image search had turned up a name for the security company logo: Palisade. I started a search on it, too.

I needed to get off HaveRatton as soon as possible, and figure out a good way to get my memory clips to Dr. Mensah.

The clips I had stashed in my arm had a lot of data drawn directly from the Milu diggers about the strange synthetics that GrayCris had illegally extracted under the guise of a terraforming operation. And the memory clip I had found in Wilken and Gerth’s gear was even more revealing. It was records of their work history for GrayCris, carefully organized and arranged, ready to submit to journalists or a corporate rival. I think it was a blackmail threat, or an attempt to ensure that GrayCris didn’t try to kill them. Whatever it was, I had it now.

Taking it and the other clips to Mensah in person would be the most secure method, and that’s what I meant to do. I just wasn’t sure I wanted to see her again. (Or more accurately, for her to see me again.)

Thinking about her brought up a whole knot of confused emotion I didn’t want to deal with right now. Or ever, actually. But it wasn’t a decision I had to make immediately. (Yeah, “Or ever, actually” applied there, too.) I could always break in to wherever she was staying and leave the clips in her belongings with a note. (I’d thought a lot about the note. I had other options but would probably go with “Hope this evidence against GrayCris helps, signed Murderbot.”) I needed to concentrate on how to find out if she was still on Port FreeCommerce or had gone back to the Preservation Alliance without—

My newsfeed search turned up a string of hits and the tagline on the top-ranked most-popular made me stop in my tracks. Luckily I was in a wide place in the mall, where the big transport lines had their offices, and the sparse crowd spread out and flowed around me. I made myself move over to the nearest office entrance, and stood in the spot where their proprietary feed was displaying advertising and informational vids. It wasn’t ideal, but I had to be somewhere where I could stand still and just concentrate on the news story.

Dr. Mensah had been accused by GrayCris of corporate espionage.

How the hell had we gotten to that point from the last newsburst I’d picked up here? There had been multiple lawsuits in play, but GrayCris had clearly been the aggressor in the violence against the survey teams. Besides all the other evidence, we had my feed recording and Mensah’s suit camera video of GrayCris representatives admitting guilt. Not even the cheap stupid half-assed bond company that had owned me could fuck that up.

Except apparently it could. And Dr. Mensah was a planetary leader from a non-corporate political entity; how could she be charged with corporate espionage? I mean, I don’t know anything about it because we never got education modules on human law stuff, but it sounded wrong.

I got past my initial outrage and managed to read the rest of the newsburst. GrayCris had made the charge, but nobody knew if they had brought an actual litigation (counterlitigation? Was that a word?) or not. It was all speculation because the journalists couldn’t find Mensah.

Wait, what?

So where was she? Where were the others? Had they gone back to Preservation and left her alone? From what I’d been able to research, Preservation’s attitude to its planetary leaders was extremely casual. At home, Dr. Mensah didn’t even need security. But it was stupid to leave her alone on Port FreeCommerce where anything could happen to her. Had happened to her.

I wanted to put my fist through the nearest corporate logo. Idiotic humans don’t understand how to be safe, idiotic humans thought every place was like stupid boring Preservation!

I needed more info; obviously I’d missed some important developments. I worked my way back up the news timeline, searching the related tags, doing it thoroughly, trying not to panic. According to records that Port FreeCommerce had made available to get the journalists off its back, Arada, Overse, Bharadwaj, and Volescu had all left for Preservation about thirty cycles ago. Mensah was supposed to follow with the others, but hadn’t. So far so good.

The next data point was buried in another story so deeply even I almost missed it. There had been a news re lease by GrayCris that Mensah had gone to TranRollinHyfa to answer their litigation, but Port FreeCommerce couldn’t confirm.

Where the fuck was TranRollinHyfa?

A frantic search on the public feed information bases told me TranRollinHyfa was a station, a major hub, where close to two hundred companies, including GrayCris, had their corporate headquarters. So, not exclusively enemy territory. Funny how that didn’t make me feel any better.

The next relevant newsburst speculated that Mensah had gone to TranRollinHyfa to pursue testimony on behalf of Preservation and DeltFall in the suit against GrayCris. The newsburst after that speculated that she was going to testify in GrayCris’ possibly apocryphal suit against her. Terrifyingly, the two entities that might actually know anything, the Preservation Alliance and my stupid half-assed ex-owner bond company on Port FreeCommerce, had made no official statement except to say she was definitely on TranRollinHyfa.

Mensah wasn’t stupid, she would never have gone near hostile corporate territory without protection. If she had gone to TranRollinHyfa voluntarily, the bond for a trip to visit GrayCris, who had already tried to kill her once, would be expensive to buy and more expensive to execute, and the company would have to agree to anything to get her out, including sending gunships. Safer and therefore cheaper to stay on Port FreeCommerce, the bond company’s major deployment center, and make all the parties with testimony come there. That’s what the company would have insisted on.

Conclusion: Mensah hadn’t gone to TranRollinHyfa voluntarily.

Somebody had tricked, trapped, or forced her to go. But why? If GrayCris was going to do that, why wait so long, why give all the witnesses involved time to bring their suits and testify and give their evidence to journalists? What had happened that had panicked GrayCris so much that …

Oh. Oh, shit.

I needed to go, and go fast. And not on a bot-piloted transport. Not finding me on Ship would throw off Palisade’s pursuit, but not for long, and if they had any brains at all they would be checking automated transports. I pulled schedules for extra-fast crewed passenger transports (No, not a direct trip. I’m apparently an idiot, but not that big an idiot.) and found one leaving in four hours heading for a major hub. From there, I could get where I needed to go.

I hadn’t traveled like this before, mainly because I hadn’t wanted to. At first, I’d doubted my ability to hack weapons scanners while I was hacking the ID and payment systems. But now I had no excuse not to, thanks to Wilken and Gerth. 

I had ended up with their emergency go-bag, filled with hard currency cards and a variety of ID markers. The markers are meant for subcutaneous insertion and contain identifying information. Normally they wouldn’t be readable by anything but the scanners designed for the purpose, but with a little fine-tuning my scan had been able to view the encoded data, and I had examined them all on the trip back to HaveRatton.

Identity markers in the Corporation Rim usually had a lot of information on the bearer, but these were temporaries meant for travelers from outside the Rim. They had a string of numbers from a non-corporate political entity authorizing travel, place of origin, and a name. Obviously this was why Wilken and Gerth had them, so they could switch identities at need. Corporate political entities are more interested in keeping track of their own humans than anybody else’s. I had seen on the media that travel was easier for non-citizens inside the Corporation Rim than citizens, sub-citizens, and all the other categories each different political entity had to keep track of their humans. (It could be worse. At least humans could cut out their ID markers; I had corporate logos etched onto parts of me I couldn’t get rid of.)

I went to a public rest area, paid for an enclosed cubicle with the hard currency card, and picked an ID with the name Jian from Parthalos Absalo. I peeled back the skin around my shoulder joint and inserted the marker under it. I had to dial down my pain receptors in that area, but there was no inconvenient leaking.

I’d been pretending to be human off and on since I left Dr. Mensah, but this was the first time I’d had anything on me that officially labeled me as human. It was weird.

I didn’t like it.

I paid for passage at a kiosk at the edge of the embarkation zone and had my new ID scanned there and at the transport’s lock when I entered. I had to hack two weapons scans, and adjust the personal scan results at the lock to show a less excessive number of augments. I’d paid for a private cabin with an attached restroom facility and automated meal delivery. (I didn’t need the meals but it would give me something to dump in the so the levels wouldn’t look off to anyone who checked.) The ship’s feed led me to the cabin and I saw only four humans in the corridor and heard five others as I passed a lounge. My goal was to not see them again the rest of the seven-cycle trip.

The cabin was nicer than the one I’d had on my only other passenger transport. It had a bunk with a bedding packet and a small display surface, a door leading to the tiny restroom facility, a storage cabinet for personal possessions, and a meal distribution receptacle. I sealed the door, didn’t bother to sit down or even drop my bag. I had feed searches to do while we were still attached to station.

I set one for TranRollinHyfa and expanded my newsburst searches with new keywords and time limits. I had already grabbed new media downloads on my walk to the embarkation zone. I knew I was going to need the distraction.

I thought I knew at least part of what was going on, and it wasn’t good. From GrayCris’ perspective, these things had happened in sequence:

1) Dr. Mensah had bought a (used, somewhat battered) SecUnit, which had then disappeared, no one knew where. 2) Dr. Mensah had said, in an interview sent out in newsbursts carried by transports all across the Corporation Rim, that someone needed to investigate Milu because GrayCris abandoning a terraforming facility was suspicious. (Never mind that the journalist had brought up Milu, not her.) 3) A SecUnit had shown up on Milu and helped an assessment team contracted by GoodNightLander Independent to a) save the facility from falling into the planet, and b) acquire proof that it was an illegal mining operation and not a terraforming facility at all.

The news of 3a and 3b was already in newsbursts making their way through the Corporation Rim, along with Abene and the others’ eyewitness accounts and Wilken and Gerth’s testimony about who had hired them.

Obviously, GrayCris thought Mensah had sent me to Milu to fuck them over.

Oops.

This was a stressful trip, right up there with the one where ART introduced itself to me by implying that it might delete my brain and the one where I kept thinking about Miki. And the one with Ayres and the other humans who had sold themselves into contract slavery.

I guess most of my trips so far had been this stressful.

This time it was anxiety, and I did what I always do, which is watch media. One of the new shows I’d downloaded randomly at HaveRatton turned out to be a long historical drama about early human exploration in space. It was listed as a fictionalized documentary (I’m not sure what that means, either) but there were attached sidebars throughout with info about the real history, which were supposedly accurate. It was odd to see that there had been a variation of SecUnits back then. They didn’t use cloned human parts, but actual human parts from humans who had catastrophic injuries or illnesses, and had decided to have their parts used for what they called Augmented Rovers. Some of the humans in the primary story line had actually known one of the ARs when it was a human, and they were all still friends. The ARs weren’t humanform, but got to choose their assignments and which humans they worked with. They talked back and forth with the humans, gave advice, sometimes led rescue parties, and saved the day a lot. Despite all the convincingly informative sidebars, I had trouble believing it was true. I stopped in the middle of the second episode and switched to a musical comedy.

Anyway, there was a difference in watching media because I was safe on a transport with no one making me do anything, and watching media because I was trying not to think about all the ways I’d screwed up and what might happen next, a future that was bound to include even more creative screw-ups on my part. I had gotten used to the former and I hated going back to the latter.

I did try to prepare. I pulled everything the transport’s feed had on TranRollinHyfa, which wasn’t much more than an updated version of the standard tourist packet that I had already downloaded from HaveRatton, but it did give me the names of a lot of the corporations that had bases or headquarters there.

The security company Palisade had a large office there. Why was that not a surprise?

I also did a lot of work on my code for beating security cameras. I had developed it on RaviHyral right before almost getting my client Tapan killed. It was a method for deleting me from the camera’s recording and replacing me with images before and after I walked past. It wasn’t perfect, and I worked on making it better, adding code to work with different types and brands of SecSystems, and a greater number of cameras and angles.

When we came through the wormhole, I was just glad the first leg of the trip was over.

Nobody was waiting for me when we docked at the transit hub so at least that told me that Wilken and Gerth’s IDs were good. I only spent ten hours there, all of it in a tiny room in a transient hostel. I downloaded some new shows, but I spent most of the time pulling files from information bases for anything on TranRollinHyfa. This took longer since most of the bases I needed access to were proprietary corporate ones and I had to hack my way in before I could even tell if they had what I was looking for or not. I also ran my usual searches on newsbursts. (Nothing new on Mensah except lots of speculation that didn’t help my anxiety level.)

When it was almost time to go, I traded out the Jian ID for one with the name Kiran. I had contemplated one more obfuscating hop, but I didn’t know what was happening with Mensah and the thought that I might already be too late wasn’t helpful. So I booked a passage on another fast passenger transport direct to TranRollinHyfa. 

I hesitated over my memory clips from Milu, the ones still hidden in my arm and Wilken and Gerth’s clip. I didn’t know how useful the information was anymore.

But Miki had died for that information, whether it knew it or not.

Taking it into GrayCris territory with me would be stupid. In the transient room, I removed the clips from my arm, then left for the embarkation zone. On the way, I stopped at a shipping kiosk and bought a small parcel package. I rolled the clips up in the protective wrapper, included Wilken and Gerth’s clip, and sealed the container. I addressed it to all of Dr. Mensah’s marital partners on their farm on Preservation. (I had all the info for the shipping form, lying around in longterm memory storage, from my old company’s records of PreservationAux. Wow, that seemed like a long time ago.)

I’d boarded my next passenger transport and was hiding in my private cabin when I caught a new newsburst, relayed from a ship that had just come in to dock. It was a brief statement from the Preservation Alliance by Dr. Bharadwaj.

It was unexpectedly odd to see a familiar human, even if she looked really angry. All she said was that Preservation was “taking steps” to resolve the issues with GrayCris.

Huh. I lay down on the bunk and stared at the metal ceiling. There was a background buzz of traffic in the ship’s public feed as the docking clamps were released. I was monitoring the private activity to make sure no one was chatting about the SecUnit hiding in a passenger cabin incompetently pretending to be human. I replayed Bharadwaj’s statement seven times.

I might be wrong. I knew interpreting the emotional subtext in the speech and appearance of real humans was completely different from interpreting it in shows and serials. (For one thing, the shows and serials were trying to communicate accurately with the viewer. As far as I could tell, real humans usually didn’t know what the hell they were doing.) But the interpretation I wanted to make of Bharadwaj’s vid statement was that Mensah was being held by GrayCris, who had threatened her life if Preservation didn’t make a formal statement at least implying that they were in amicable negotiations to settle with GrayCris.

I looked back over the newsburst that had accompanied it and found there was still no statement by DeltFall, whose survey team GrayCris had slaughtered. Or my ex-owner the company, which was probably torn between fury and shitting itself over the amount of equipment and bond payments lost in the debacle and desperate to have someone pay for it. I mean, literally pay for it. GrayCris could buy the company off for a big enough credit payout but so far it hadn’t done that. But maybe GrayCris couldn’t afford that payout.

GrayCris had done all this to acquire strange synthetics, alien remnants. Now that everybody knew that, they couldn’t sell them, or develop them, or whatever they had been planning to do with them. It meant they were desperate, too.

That wasn’t good.

After four cycles by ship’s local time, the passenger transport came through the wormhole and I picked up the edge of the TranRollinHyfa Station feed.

It looked bigger up close. The station itself was larger than Port FreeCommerce, with three interconnected transit rings below the main hull. Usually the transit ring circles the station, with the main part where humans and augmented humans live or do whatever in the center. Or, I guess, I’ve never been in those parts except for the deployment center on Port FreeCommerce, which was near the transit ring.

I picked up the feed but it was crammed with advertising, with the transit schedules and service listings swamped by corporation ads that were dissolving into static because other corporations had paid fees to drown them out. Well, that was all useless. I dropped it and picked up the ship’s comm, which was monitoring the Port Authority’s feed. There were still ads, but at least the PA was able to get a word in edgewise every now and then. One of those words was a navigation alert and—

Huh.

I pulled it up on the transport’s feed, where the scan and nav was running for the crew. There was a company gunship hanging off the station.

Not on approach, not waiting for a docking slot. Just maintaining position.

There was no mistake about who owned it, the navigation alert included the stupid logo the gunship was broadcasting in its otherwise blocked feed, the same logo etched into my non-organic parts. I checked the alert’s timestamp. Converted to my local time it equaled twenty cycles, give or take.

It could have been here for another contract, but that seemed like a big coincidence. Gunships don’t have any other purpose except to go fast and blow stuff up, and contracts for them are tricky, because of the treaties between corporate and non-corporate political entities.

I had thought that if Mensah had actually gone to TranRollinHyfa voluntarily to negotiate with GrayCris, then the bond might have been high enough to require a gunship. But then why wasn’t it docked? Did Mensah need rescuing or what? I needed intel, and there was one way to get it.

The station approach traffic was heavy, and we were showing a twenty-seven-minute docking delay. Twenty-seven minutes was more than enough time for me to do something stupid.

I sank into the ship’s comm. The approach protocol the PA had managed to slip out between ads stipulated that comms be set to monitor all signal traffic, voice and feed. This was so ships could bypass the choked station feed and pick up any alerts or alarms the other ships might broadcast.

It was harder to sort and separate them without the comm system assisting but I knew what I was looking for. After six minutes I found it: the company gunship’s encrypted feed, twined around its comm signal like the melody in a music sample. I pulled the feed in and applied the key, and—this could be a mistake, did I need intel this badly? Yeah, yeah, I did. I needed to know if Mensah was here on a mission or under duress—I sent the gunship’s bot pilot a ping and added the code that would tell it I was in stealth mode.

It acknowledged. It recognized me as also company property, since I had the decryption key and I was using the right salutation. I didn’t think it would notify its crew that it had been contacted by what it had every reason to identify as another company bot, not unless someone had told it to. Another SecUnit would have reported me immediately, but then a SecUnit would have known what I was and that I shouldn’t be out here.

I waited, listening in to make sure no one had noticed the offsite connection. No alarms were raised. I could tell feed traffic aboard the ship was light, and mostly in standby mode. They were waiting for something.

I mentally braced myself and sent the bot pilot Status: update (stealth). After a long three seconds, it returned a databurst. I sent an acknowledgment and broke free of the connection.

I focused on the ceiling of the cabin again. If I was lucky, nobody would check the bot pilot’s contact log. The company had been paid for me and taken me off inventory, but I had no legal status in corporate territory without Mensah. If they realized I was here, they could report me to station authorities, or decide to catch me and forcibly separate me into my component parts, or anything in between.

I checked the databurst for tracers and malware and then unpacked it.

Well, this was … potentially a disaster. Shortly after the gunship had arrived at TranRollinHyfa, the contract status had gone from Retrieve: Active to Retrieve: Suspended Due to Neutral Party Access Denial, Escalation Out of Contracted Parameters. That meant that the gunship had been sent to retrieve an endangered client, but the operation had been halted because the retrieval had been blocked, and by something other than just being beyond the range of the client’s ability to pay. The client ID code was Mensah’s, the same one from my contract, which meant this was an extension of her original safety bond for the planetary survey. Which, okay, I didn’t know it worked like that, but it was confirmation Mensah was here, or at least that the company’s current intel thought she was here.

And the fucking gunship was sitting out here not doing anything about it. I’m guessing GrayCris had somehow gotten TranRollinHyfa to refuse docking and operational permission, meaning the company couldn’t land its armed retrieval team without fighting TRH station security and the company hadn’t been paid enough to do that.

The other code in the status was Secondary Clients Status: Recognizance. That was almost worse—it meant someone else named in the bond (probably Pin-Lee, Ratthi, or Gurathin, since they hadn’t been listed in the newsburst as returning to Preservation) had left company protection and were in the wind. There was only one way to be in the wind between a gunship and an armed station: they must have taken a shuttle, certified themselves as unarmed to get past the operational prohibition, and been allowed to dock.

So that was four of them I had to worry about. 

Waiting was stressful, and I watched an episode of my favorite, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, while the transport finished its approach and went through docking procedures. Then the ship’s feed signaled that it was time to disembark.

One reason I’d picked this particular fast non-bot-piloted transport out of the others heading here was because there were 127 passengers, forty-three of whom were traveling together. They didn’t disappoint me and disembarked in a single noisy confused mob. I walked out surrounded by them and was across the embarkation floor and up into the transparent pipe of the elevated walkway before they became distracted by the vending and advertising bays and started to thin out. I kept walking.

By that point I’d deflected three weapons scans and had hacked the restricted feeds for the various drone security cameras. The security was tighter for disembarking passengers than the other transit rings and stations I’d visited. Unusually tight for a station that sold its public feed for ads that drowned out the safety info and official announcements. (You could tell which humans and augmented humans were trying to use its mapping function because they kept walking up to blocked exits and walls.)

I had also been hit by at least four different recognition scans. These scans are usually searching for known humans or augmented humans that the station security is keeping tabs on, not random escaped SecUnits. (Random escaped SecUnits is not nearly as prevalent a problem as the entertainment feed would have you believe.) But I was glad I’d listened to ART and let it change my configuration. I was glad for every single precaution I’d taken, even the ones that had seemed paranoid at the time.

I didn’t spot any armed security patrols but there were extra drones, small ones, a different brand and configuration than the ones I was used to. After I modified my queries to block the stupid ads, I got a download and search of the news feed started, as well as the port’s public dock assignment list. I checked the port map that had managed to fight its way through the advertising chaff, and took the walkway heading up into the station mall.

My transport had docked on the second transit ring, so there were a lot of ramps to walk up, if you didn’t want to take the lift pods, which I didn’t. I wasn’t catching pings, but a check of the station directory showed two security companies based here who had SecUnits available for rental, EinoArzu and Stockade Kumaran. Palisade was listed as a security company, but not as a company that supplied SecUnits. That didn’t necessarily mean they didn’t have them, it just meant they didn’t advertise them.

I wasn’t too worried about SecUnits being used against me at this point. SecUnits would be able to identify me as a rogue unit on sight (or on ping, more accurately) but we were never used on transit rings. The security companies would ship us (them) through the port as cargo, to keep from panicking the humans. I mean, there’s a first time for everything, but it just wasn’t likely, maybe a fifteen percent chance at best.

Even if they did deploy, they still had to find me. The governor modules wouldn’t let the SecUnits hack systems or search for my hacks, not on their own without human direction. (And I didn’t think GrayCris had any idea how much hacking I was responsible for.) Only combat SecUnits could detect or counteract my hacks without a human supervisor.

Still, my human skin was prickling with nerves. The extra security seemed to support a theory I had. Or maybe I mean a hypothesis. Whatever, the idea was that if Bharadwaj’s statement in the newsburst had been a message to GrayCris, a sign that Preservation would cooperate to save Dr. Mensah, then the stories about Mensah being arrested, about her going to or somehow being taken to TranRollinHyfa were messages, too. Messages to me.

GrayCris thought the newsbursts were how Mensah had ordered me to go to Milu, so it stood to reason they would use newsbursts to lure me here.

It wasn’t a great theory/hypothesis. They had Mensah, so I don’t know why they would want me. They knew I’d been on Milu, did they suspect I had left with an armful of incriminating data? But GoodNightLander Independent had Milu now and would hopefully be mad enough to look for incriminating data of their own, so they could publicly complain about it on their own newsfeeds. GrayCris going after me and Mensah wasn’t going to stop that.

But they were humans—who knows why they did anything?

It made it all the more obvious that now that I’d gotten in here, I needed to make sure I could get out. Speaking of which, I pulled specs and info from the security feeds I’d accessed, and tagged it to work on later.

I walked up the last ramp surrounded by a crowd of humans and augmented humans, and on into the station mall. There was no fringe travelers’ area, with cheap transient hostels and vending kiosks. It went straight into multi-levels of expensive shops and offices, most in spheres, stacked into looming towers or hovering overhead. The feed was a maze of vids and ads and instructions and music, competing with the floating display surfaces and the holosculptures of giant waterfalls and trees and abstract art things. I’d seen similar, and better, on my shows, but seeing it in person was different. My camera angles weren’t as good, for one thing. And the humans and augmented humans wandering around randomly were distracting from the view.

Oh, and there were downloads, sweet downloads, multiple entertainment feeds, way more than HaveRatton and Port FreeCommerce, hanging temptingly in the air. I picked a couple at random and started downloads. One of my queries had pulled up the station’s actual index for residents, not the abbreviated one for tourists and transients, and I needed a place to stand still to review it. I headed toward one of the lower-level spheres.

It was a big shop, with lots of humans and augmented humans going in and out. I could do a shop. I’d done shops (one shop) before. No problem.

I tried to relax and look preoccupied as I took the ramp up to the entrance. The shop’s feed ads said it sold advanced lifestyles. I don’t know what that is and the explanations in the feed weren’t helpful. Even some of the humans wandering around looked confused. I wandered with them into a central area where humans were watching a hovering display of products? Art and music inspired by products? It wasn’t the enclosed booth I was hoping for, but it gave me a reason to stand still and stare while I reviewed my query results and the station index.

Not a surprise, I had turned up a dock listing for a shuttle with a company ID code, the only company code in the arrivals index. That was the shuttle the Preservation team had used to get here from the gunship. 

It was … strange, knowing they were so close. Considering the size of the shuttle, they probably weren’t staying on board. After a little delicate unraveling of the Port Authority’s protected systems, I got a download of the docking contact index and matched the shuttle’s entry with a physical address in a station hotel.

Three newssearch results popped up while I was deleting any trace of my intrusion from the PA’s system, but they were old newsbursts from Port FreeCommerce. Just more useless speculation on where Mensah was and what she was doing, why she had disappeared.

None of my queries had turned up any mention of her.

I didn’t have a lot of choice. The team from Preservation must be here to negotiate for Mensah’s release, the only way they could proceed until Preservation scraped up enough currency to pay the company to violate TranRollinHyfa’s docking ban. I needed intel before I could do anything, and they were my only potential source.

I left the shop, first making sure to do one loop of the aimless wander around the displays that the humans were doing.

I had to go meet some old friends.

The hotel was at the far end of the station mall, in a quieter area with 60 percent less foot and drone traffic, next to a multi-level plaza. All the structures around it were office blocks or hotels, all were shaped like giant cones or cylinders, except for one either iconoclast or outdated sphere, which seemed to be holding on to its real estate despite the fact that the station had tried to block it from view with a large holo forest display.

I crossed one of the multi-level plazas, where humans and augmented humans were sitting singly and in groups at scattered tables and chairs, talking, viewing entertainment media on the displays, or working in their feeds. Surveillance was tight so I started one of the new codes I had written on the way here.

I had been thinking about other ways to look less like a SecUnit. (An obvious option was to pretend to eat or drink something, but that was tricky. I can do that if I have to, but only for a limited time. I don’t have anything like a digestive system so I have to segregate a section of my lung to store it until I can expel it. Yes, it’s just as awful as it sounds.) I’d decided on something more subtle and less disgusting. Humans, even augmented humans, subvocalize when they speak on the feed. I had written a quick set of code that I could run in background to mimic those jaw movements. (I pulled a selection of conversations from Sanctuary Moon, Legends of the Fire, and Toward Tomorrow to use as a template for the movements.) As I crossed the plaza toward the hotel I made sure my shoulders were relaxed and my expression was distracted. I picked up a camera feed from one of the drones watching the plaza for a look. Operating in concert with my code to mimic human breathing patterns and small random movements, it was perfect. Well, perfect for me. Let’s say 98 percent perfect.

The Preservation group’s hotel had a big terraced entrance with transparent walls and a wide doorway. A track for the station’s pipe transport ran through a transparent upper floor of the structure, so you could see passengers disembarking and boarding inside when the chain of pipe capsules arrived. (I could see them via the higher-flying drones; the other humans in the plaza couldn’t.)

I identified two potential hostiles sitting at tables in the plaza.

At the hotel entrance, I blended with a crowd of humans and augmented humans who were watching a floating advertising display that was showing funny short videos. (Some were pretty good so I saved them to permanent storage.) It also gave me a place to stand while I worked my way into the hotel’s security system. I had the improved version of my RaviHyral code routine to remove myself from camera views ready to deploy if needed.

When the video display started to repeat, I followed another group of humans through the entrance. I probably sound confident, but the scan at the arched doorway made my human skin prickle. I knew the kind of chance I was taking in coming here.

The lobby was a series of wide platforms with seating. It also had giant hanging biospheres full of simulated planetary skies, all displaying different weather. Ostensibly they were there to obscure the view of the seating platforms and provide some privacy, but they actually had the security system’s cameras and scanners along the rims. As I watched myself through the cameras I spotted four more potential hostiles, all augmented humans. One was clearly in the feed, reviewing the scan results, and the others were moving around, doing visual sweeps.

No telling if they were GrayCris or Palisade, though if they were the hotel would know they were here. I couldn’t tell if they were looking for me; there were no standing alerts in the security comm feed. Though from their affect they were paying close attention to augmented humans wearing any kind of hood, hat, or scarf, or face-obscuring tattoos, cosmetics, or ornaments. Me, a generic type augmented human person with my hood folded down on my back, didn’t get a second glance.

This is why humans shouldn’t do their own security.

I went up the ramp to the check-in platform, followed the directional feed with its welcoming musical theme and instructions to a kiosk, and booked a room with one of Gerth’s hard currency cards.

Yes, I did enjoy doing that.

I took the rear exit off the platform to the pod junction and followed five humans into the first pod to arrive. It was a limited system, no outside connections, and would only take you to the room section now tied to your ID marker by the hotel’s feed, or the lobbies and public entertainment sections. The pod took us to our sections in order of arrival, so it gave me a chance to watch the system in operation and copy its code. It took me to my section and I followed the feed map to my room.

It opened at the authorization the hotel had attached to my ID marker and at that brilliant moment I discovered there were no interior camera views or audio surveillance. Stupid hotel. I had probably even paid extra for it.

Still, the room was bigger and much nicer than the cabins I’d had on the passenger transports. I did a quick walk-through to scan for anomalies, then dropped my bag and lay down on the bed. (It was huge. Why have a bed that could easily accommodate four medium to large humans when you only had one hook for towels in the bath facility? Were the humans supposed to share the towel?) The wall across from the unnecessarily large bed was all display surface. To keep me company, I sent an episode of Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon to it to play—holy shit, the humans were almost actual size in the long shots—and then I got to work.

So there were no camera feeds from the rooms, but the cameras in the corridors were picking up humans and augmented humans as they moved through the connecting passages and used the transport pods to go to and from the lobbies and the three sections of food and club areas. (Whatever “clubs” were. The things going on there didn’t seem to match my lexicon definition.) There was also a transport link to the pipe train level.

I worked my way carefully into the system, alert for traps. Without room cameras I was going to have to do this the hard way.

Like most surveillance systems on non-secure installations, this one didn’t save their recordings permanently and supposedly deleted their archives after a waiting period. Note I said “supposedly.” Of course, the hotel was datamining.

The mining was only on the conversations in the public areas and corridors, but then that was what I needed. I found the stored archives from the past twenty cycles, took over one of the routines that was processing it (it was separating out the boring bits from the juicy business conversations that would need to be sent to a human or bot monitor for review), and redirected it to search for my keyword set. 

Eight minutes and thirty-seven seconds later, my captured routine turned up a sizable set of hits. I got the timestamps, then released the routine back to its job of searching for proprietary financial information. The timestamps let me know which archives to check for the camera surveillance.

I made some room in my temp storage, downloaded the first archive, and started my scans. I was reviewing it all myself instead of using a quicker and more efficient facial recognition scan on the collected data. That type of scan is only 62 percent reliable under most conditions and while that’s fine for half-assed company security work, I didn’t want to miss my targets. It turned out I could have started there instead of wasting the eight minutes, because in the first pass I caught an image of Ratthi in a corridor, walking toward a pod junction, timestamp sixteen hours and twenty-seven minutes minus present time.

Gotcha.

I kept reviewing the surveillance. Ratthi should have put in some time reviewing it, too, or at least looking around a little, because two potential hostiles followed him to the junction. They didn’t try to get on the same pod, but they clearly had access to the security system, because they were there when I picked Ratthi up in the lobby again. They followed him to the stores and vending areas in the hotel’s lower level, then back to his room. Now that I knew to focus on that section of the hotel, I was able to eliminate a lot of video from other camera feeds, and within three minutes I picked up both Gurathin and Pin-Lee. All three were being followed, whenever they went out.

This wasn’t unexpected, given that GrayCris had to know they were here. But I’d been doing some risk assessments in background and there was a scenario where this was a trap for me, where the Preservation team was bait.

Mensah might be the face of the group of political entities and companies determined to get GrayCris for killing their citizens/employees. But I was the one who had made the recordings of the most important evidence, I was the active component of the company SecSystem who had collected and stored all that data. If I was shown to be unreliable, compromised, whatever, then the SecSystem’s data could be called into question and that might help GrayCris’ case.

Another possibility was that the Preservation team had been contacted by GrayCris and asked to lure me here in exchange for Mensah’s release. Yeah, that possibility was no fun at all.

I watched Ratthi on the recordings, but the automated system had had no reason to zoom in and the resolution wasn’t good enough for a real evaluation. But I ran a few of my archived records from the survey mission: Ratthi walking when he was tired after a long day, absorbed in a conversation as he walked with Arada and Overse, laughing and pretending to defend himself as Pin-Lee threw a cushion at him, running as we frantically loaded a hopper to escape.

I wanted to say he walked through this hotel like it was a prison, but I wasn’t sure. Real humans don’t act like the ones in the media.

I’d just have to wait and see. (And yes, that was painfully stressful.)

The surveillance was an interesting problem, but not unsolvable. Everywhere but in the lobby, the hotel had its own secured feed, which it charged extra to access. To encourage use, the hotel was choking the public feed. This meant the security system already had code in place to redirect feed accesses. That was convenient for me. I set some alerts on the various feeds in play and started picking which shows I wanted to watch on my gigantic display surface. I only picked old favorites I had watched before, though, because I really needed to buckle down and work on some new code. With luck, I wouldn’t need it, but … Let’s face it, I would probably need it.

Five hours and seventeen minutes later Pin-Lee, Ratthi, and Gurathin left their room and headed toward the pod junction. Twenty-three seconds after they left their room, the system registered a door opening and closing in the same section. Two hostiles exited the room to follow the Preservation team, and I was able to set a redirect on the feed stream they were using to get orders and deliver reports.

I waited to see if the Preservation team were just going to one of the food service or entertainment areas. It would be safer (for everybody, but especially me) to approach them outside the hotel.

I checked the feed stream the two hostiles used to get their orders and saw my redirect had worked. They stopped at the pod junction, confused, waiting for the go-ahead from their controller. My redirect had sent that go-ahead to the housekeeping bots in another section. The redirect was set to expire and delete itself in two minutes and would look like a glitch due to the hotel’s feed-choking.

The Preservation team took the pod to the lobby and headed out through the front entrance. I reluctantly shut down my giant display surface and rolled off the bed.

Time to go to work.

I took my bag with me because it was likely I wouldn’t come back here. (Yes, I was going to miss that display surface.) It also had my projectile weapon, and you never could tell when you might need armor-piercing fire power. (And I could hook my right hand on the strap, which gave me something to do with that arm. How humans decide what to do with their arms on a second-by-second basis, I still have no idea.)

I caught up with Pin-Lee, Ratthi, and Gurathin in the plaza, with no sign of any hostiles trailing them. I wasn’t sure the Preservation team knew GrayCris was surveilling them, though Ratthi’s shoulders seemed a little stiff, not the way he usually walked. Then they started up the stairs to the second-level seating area and Gurathin glanced back in what he probably thought was a totally casual and not at all suspicious way. Yeah, they knew.

No, he didn’t spot me. I was using the drone cams to keep track of them so I could take another route through the plaza, the one that led under the platforms through the gardens and vending areas.

Gurathin said something to Pin-Lee as they crossed the plaza and they sped up a little, heading for the shopping block on the far side. It was a good place to avoid visual surveillance from a tail and also gave me time to make minor adjustments to the security cams so it was more difficult to track them. GrayCris security would realize by now that they had lost them and I wanted to make sure they couldn’t pick them up again. I didn’t know if GrayCris had paid off the station to get access to their public space security video, but it was better to be safe than sorry.

Pin-Lee led the other two on a convoluted route through the shopping block, through various stores and plazas, and ended up in an open garden seating area at the foot of another cone-shaped hotel. It was a good effort, designed to take them through six different private security jurisdictions and private feed areas, a good way to lose a tail trying to follow you using drones or security cams. It didn’t lose me, of course, but it was a great way to lose normal (human) surveillance. And the seating area was surrounded by curtains of falling water, obscuring the view from the surrounding plazas and walkways.

I stopped outside the entrance, joining a small crowd of humans beside a store projecting more artsy product videos into the feed. On the hotel’s security cam I watched Pin-Lee and Gurathin have a short argument, which Ratthi tried to mediate, that ended with Gurathin and Ratthi taking a seat at a table and Pin-Lee walking away into the mercantile area next to the hotel’s lobby.

I know, I could have contacted them by now, either by establishing a secure connection on their feeds, or just walking up and saying hi. I just … wasn’t sure. 

Okay, I was scared. Or nervous. Nervous-scared.

Were they my sort-of human friends? My clients? My ex-owners, though legally that was only Dr. Mensah. Were they going to see me and yell for help, alert security?

And if it was this hard with Ratthi and Pin-Lee (Gurathin had never liked me and it was mutual), what was it going to be like with Mensah, if I managed to get that far?

I didn’t know if I could trust them. I wanted to. But I want a lot of things—freedom, unlimited downloads, new episodes of Drama Sun Islands—most of which I wasn’t going to get.

I walked through the garden seating area, which was only 37 percent occupied, but Ratthi and Gurathin didn’t notice me. I scanned them as I went by, and picked up Gurathin’s augments but no energy signatures indicating weapons. Ratthi rubbed his eyes and sighed. Gurathin’s hard mouth was actually betraying some dismay.

I went through the open doorway into the mercantile area, which was light on the usual vending machines but had a lot of kiosks for various businesses, including passenger transport lines, station real estate, planetary real estate in this system and others, a lot of banks, and security companies. (Not Palisade, which catered only to corporate clients.) The area security was robust, but I couldn’t pick up any facial recognition scans. The feed was choked and privatized, any humans or augmented humans not registered with the hotel required to pay a fee to use it, and the security was all focused on theft-prevention. At the far end of the space was an access to a transit platform; it didn’t lead to the pipe, but to something called “transit bubbles.”

I found Pin-Lee standing at a kiosk for a local security company, her expression grim, but she hadn’t put her hand in the access field yet. I saw tension in her body language, particularly in the way she held her head. Whatever it was she had come here to do, she didn’t want to do it.

It hit me then, how all those cycles of watching Pin-Lee on our contract had made me trust her judgment. If she didn’t want to do it, she probably had a good reason. I had to talk to her, give her another option.

If it had been one of the others, I would have figured out a different approach. For Pin-Lee, I just said, “Hi.”

She barely glanced at me, her expression set with disinterest. Then she took another look, frowned, started to speak, then stopped herself. She still wasn’t sure. I said, “We met on Port FreeCommerce.” I couldn’t resist adding, “I was the one in the transport box.”

Her eyes widened, then narrowed. She forced her tense shoulders to relax, and she didn’t make the mistake of looking around. She planted a smile on her face and said through gritted teeth, “What—How—”

“I came to find our friend,” I said. “Do you want to get in a transit bubble?” Local mass transport is usually easy to secure against potential surveillance and security screens. (Yes, it’s supposed to be the opposite. Yes, you should worry.)

She hesitated, then forced her smile wider. It looked fake and angry, but it was the thought that counted. “Sure.”

We crossed the room and walked up the access ramp to the station. A burst of feed advertising explained that the bubbles were a cup-shaped lift platform lined with padded benches, with a transparent bubble shield over the top so the humans couldn’t manage to fall out no matter how hard they tried. (The ad didn’t describe it that way.) The bubbles floated along a set path over the commercial segments and were much slower than the transit pipes, so they were mostly used for sightseeing. They also looked convenient for awkward conversations.

Only a few humans were in the station, stepping out of a just-arrived bubble. We walked up to the first rack and I paid with another hard currency card and—Wow, that was three times the price of my last transient hostel. It’s a good thing I don’t have to eat.

Pin-Lee climbed in first, eyeing me with what I wanted to interpret as discreet wariness but maybe wasn’t. I sat down on the opposite bench and selected the option for an overhead tour of this segment’s shopping park. The door sealed and the bubble floated up to join the line of others passing over the hotel.

The bubble had a camera feed, but it was the kind meant to alert on certain words, sounds, and motions, probably only there to cut down on random murders. I blocked its audio feed and said, “Clear.”

She glared at me. “You left.”

Somehow I hadn’t expected that. I said, “Mensah said I could learn to do anything I wanted. I learned to leave.”

“You could have told her what you wanted. We—she—we were worried, okay.” My gaze was on the view behind her, using the bubble’s camera to study her face. She pressed her lips together, cutting off whatever she was going to say next. Then she regrouped and continued, “I saw the goodbye message you sent her. It’s not like she didn’t realize that we’d fucked up the whole situation.”

I was having an emotion, and I hate that. I’d rather have nice safe emotions about shows on the entertainment media; having them about things real-life humans said and did just led to stupid decisions like coming to TranRollinHyfa. And they hadn’t fucked up the whole situation. Parts of it, sure. But it’s not like I knew what to do with me, either. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

She sighed, a tired but angry sigh, and pressed her fingers to her forehead. I had to quell an impulse to tap my nonexistent MedSystem and ask for a diagnosis. She said, “So where the fuck did you go? And what are you doing here?” She hesitated warily. “Are you working for someone, on contract?”

That was the whole point of leaving. “Either I’m Mensah’s property, and I work for her, or I’m a free agent and I work for myself.”

Glare intensifying. “Okay, so what did you hire yourself to do?”

That was an interesting way to put it. I kind of liked it. And it felt so weird to be talking to a human like this, a human who knew what I was. I didn’t have to force myself to stare at Pin-Lee’s face, worry that my expressions were normal. Abene had known I was a SecUnit, but she hadn’t known I was me. “I’ve been traveling, and I saw a newsburst that said Mensah was missing. Did they trick her into coming here, or was she abducted?”

Her eyes narrowed again, but this time more in speculation. “You’ve really just been wandering around watching that serial. We were afraid GrayCris might catch you, but they kept demanding you be submitted as part of the evidence process. It seemed like they would have let us know if they had you, gloated about it.”

“I’ve been wandering around watching a lot of serials.” I waited. Pin-Lee had always been the tough one, and it took her time to let down her guard. Like all the others, I had hundreds of hours of stored audio and video of her. I didn’t need to review it to know her nerves were stretched thin from fear for Mensah, from the responsibility for the others’ lives.

She said finally, “So you came to help us. Why should I trust you? You obviously don’t trust us.”

If I could answer that, I’d probably be a lot better off. I didn’t trust them, not with some things. I had no idea why they should trust me. “I pulled a status report from the company gunship. They aren’t going to help you unless the station lifts the docking prohibition. You’re on your own. Or you’re on your own with Ratthi and Gurathin, which may be worse.” 

She grimaced. “I forgot what an asshole you are.”

Well, yeah. I said, “I need intel to make a plan.”

She looked at the view, and winced a little at the flashing ad display circling the spire we were passing. “They took her off Port FreeCommerce, after a meeting with DeltFall representatives. Some of the families of the victims had traveled in to personally collect the remains, there were a lot of people there, it was emotional. She stepped away for a minute afterward, and she was gone. The security cams showed the moment when they grabbed her, but by that time they had already taken her off the station. With some help from our diplomatic corps on Preservation, I convinced the company that this was their problem, that they had fucked up so badly with our survey bond that they owed us. Then GrayCris sent a demand that Preservation drop our suit against them and make a public announcement to that effect. We’ve done that, and now we’re here to negotiate a ransom.” Her expression tightened. “We’ve got people on Preservation working to free up assets, but right now we don’t have nearly as much as they want.”

So I was right, and GrayCris did need money. “But no company contract support?”

“Not after TRH refused to let them dock. They did give us a key for the fail-safe interface implant Mensah bought in case of emergency, but Gurathin said it’s blocked because she’s being held somewhere in the torus above us, behind the main station security barrier, and it’s dampening the signal.”

“Do you have it with you?” I asked. It might be blocked for Gurathin, but not for me.

She unsealed an inside pocket on her jacket and handed me the key, which was designed to look like a feed-accessible memory clip. I downloaded the address information and spent one minute and forty-three seconds trying to access Mensah’s implant. So it was actually blocked for me, too. “Gurathin may be right about the main station security barrier.” I hated to say it.

Pin-Lee slumped in disappointment. “We don’t have much longer to raise the ransom. I was going to try to hire a local security company to help us, and just hope the one I picked hadn’t been paid off by GrayCris.” She looked away from the window, eyeing me again. “Speaking of pay-offs, the company is playing a double game, right?”

I was glad Pin-Lee had thought of that already and wasn’t going to deny reality. “There’s a ninety-five percent chance,” I told her. The company is like an evil vending machine, you put money in and it does what you want, unless somebody else puts more money in and tells it to stop. GrayCris’ best option at this point was to pour as much money in as possible.

Pin-Lee groaned and rubbed her face. “I’m almost glad you’re here.” 

When our bubble returned to the station, I went to a hotel kiosk to book a room and Pin-Lee went to get the others. She thought we needed to talk as a group in private. I sort of did, too. (We could have done it via the feed in the garden seating area, but I didn’t trust the humans not to wave their arms and draw attention.)

I took a pod up to the room and of course there was no security feed inside because of the stupid hotel wanting to lure humans in with promises of room privacy so it could record them in the public spaces. This hotel was less expensive than the previous one but the pretty quotient was about the same. And the feed was choked, unless of course you happened to know how to get around that.

The room was a lot more practical, with a normal-sized bed folded up into the wall to leave extra space for chairs, and a display surface that only took up a fourth of a wall instead of all of it, and a bathing facility with more room for towels. SecUnits are never allowed to sit down or use human furniture whether on or off duty, so I sat in one of the chairs and put my feet up on the table. Then I took my feet off the table because it wasn’t comfortable. I entertained myself by infiltrating the hotel’s security system while I waited.

When the room’s feed signaled that they were at the door, I told it to open. I was in my best casual pose, and Sanctuary Moon was on the display surface. (I was actually redirecting the audio as chaff for a suspicious monitor that the hotel might be using to record inside the rooms, even though the booking agreement certified complete in-room privacy.)

Pin-Lee elbowed the other two in and let the door slide closed. She had clearly told them already, because Ratthi was grinning. He said, “You look great! What have you been doing?”

Gurathin’s expression I interpreted as appalled. I still don’t like you, either.

“Ratthi, later,” Pin-Lee said. She stepped past them and dropped down into the other armchair. “SecUnit doesn’t need to tell us where it’s been or what it’s been doing unless it wants to. We need to focus on how to free Mensah.”

I didn’t expect that and I was glad I was looking at the display surface. The lack of a camera was going to make this awkward, at least for me. I could sort of see everyone in the decorative reflective material at the top of the walls, but that was inadequate.

Gurathin took a breath to say something and Pin-Lee pointed at him. “If you’re going to argue—”

Gurathin grimaced and held up his hands in surrender. “No, no argument. I just don’t see how SecUnit is going to help. They won’t release Mensah without the ransom, and we don’t have it.”

Ratthi told me, “Our company liaison said they were probably holding her in the GrayCris corporate headquarters in the upper torus, past the main station security barrier, where visitors aren’t allowed. Now that you’re here—can we just get her out, and escape?”

It was a dumb idea, so I needed to quash it immediately. I’d already secured a private feed connection between the four of us and now I sent my annotated station map into it. “The problem isn’t that GrayCris’ corporate headquarters is in the upper torus.” I sent the image to the room’s display surface, then had it zoom out and plot the route between here and there. I had all the security checkpoints light up, annotating the ones that barred entrance to anyone with a non-station citizen ID, which was all of them. “It’s that we would be leaving territory controlled by neutral TRH security and entering GrayCris’ corporate jurisdiction.” I didn’t know what they’d do to me, now that my data port was nonfunctional and they couldn’t take control of me. There was a long list of alternatives, including just shooting me until I ceased to function and various other things that would seem sensible and practical to them and like torture to me. Whatever, it wasn’t a good idea to get caught, basically. “In this lower ring, GrayCris has to negotiate with and pay off TRH, and any private security service or entity who has jurisdiction, for each operation, which gives us a slight advantage.”

“Oh.” Ratthi sat back in his chair, dismayed. “Even with support from the bond company gunship? I mean, the company said they won’t violate the TRH edict to come aboard the station, but they are out there, with big guns…”

Frankly I hoped they stayed out there. I said, “If GrayCris can’t make you disappear, they want to delay you. They’re probably raising the money to buy off the company. The gunship is also here to exert pressure on GrayCris while the company is negotiating with their reps back on Port FreeCommerce. That ransom GrayCris asked for Mensah’s return will probably go straight to the company, as part of the pay-off.”

Ratthi was clearly shocked. Pin-Lee let out a frustrated breath and said, “That’s what our diplomatic corps on Preservation thought.”

Ratthi turned to her. “You didn’t tell us that!”

Gurathin folded his arms. “I knew it.”

I couldn’t let that one go. I turned and gave him my best skeptical stare. Surprisingly, it worked. He admitted, “I suspected it.”

Pin-Lee was asking Ratthi, “Did you want to know? I was hoping to get Mensah and get out of here before GrayCris managed to negotiate the payoff.”

Ratthi groaned. “No, I didn’t want to know. What happens to Mensah and us if GrayCris makes a deal with the company while we’re here?”

Pin-Lee lifted a hand helplessly and Gurathin looked more sour. He said, “Guess.”

I said, “It’s possible GrayCris can’t afford the payoff.” They might be desperately trying to sell off their alien remnant and strange synthetic collection before even more word got out about Milu. It was against the corporate/political entity interdicts to have alien materials, which meant GrayCris could only trade in it as long as no one knew. The bond company wouldn’t take alien remnants in payment unless they couldn’t be traced to it. There was no chance of that now. Which meant GrayCris was that much more desperate.

In the reflection I watched Pin-Lee look at me. “Is there any way we—you—can get her out without the ransom?”

I had been running possible scenarios, partly to drown out the sound of humans making stupid suggestions. (Not that I don’t like that sound; it’s sort of comforting and familiar, in an annoying way.) “It would be tricky,” I said. By tricky I meant I was getting an average of an 85 percent chance of failure and death, and it was only that low because my last diagnostic said my risk assessment module was wonky. (I know, that explains a lot about me.) “We need to find a way to make them bring her outside the main station security barrier so that I can track her location via her company implant.”

I was going to suggest a hack of their messaging systems, not that I had any idea how to get into those systems yet. Or if that would even work, since presumably a high-security prisoner transfer would need to be signed off by a human or augmented human supervisor who might ask unanswerable questions. But Pin-Lee turned to Ratthi and Gurathin and said, “We could offer them the ransom and arrange an exchange in one of these hotels.”

Ratthi nodded slowly, considering it. “But how much do they know about our finances? Will they know it’s a lie?”

Pin-Lee made an abrupt gesture. “We don’t have to show them a hard currency card.”

Gurathin leaned forward. “I can come up with a convincing feed document listing some of Preservation’s off-planet assets. They don’t need to know that those assets can’t be exchanged yet. But once we get them to bring her to the meeting—”

It wasn’t a terrible plan. It probably wasn’t even in the top ten of terrible plans. I said, “We don’t have to get them to bring her all the way to the meeting. We just need to get them to move her outside that security barrier so I can find her.”

Gurathin turned to me. “If they do, you can take her away from them, no matter how many guards?”

I was beginning to think Gurathin’s asshole expression was some congenital condition he had no control over. I said, “The more guards the better.”

He lifted his brows. “Are you going to kill them?”

Scratch that, Gurathin’s asshole expression is due to him being an asshole.

I could lie, I could say oh no, I won’t kill them, I’m a nice SecUnit. I think I was going to say that, or the more believable version of it. Instead what came out was, “If I have to.”

There was a little silence. Pin-Lee had her lips folded in and didn’t say anything. But I recognized her committed expression from my archived video, from the moment in the hopper when the satellite connection dropped, and she voted to keep going to DeltFall. Ratthi’s face was a study in conflicted resolution. Gurathin just said, “You feel you’re qualified to make that call.”

I said, “I’m the security expert. You’re the humans who walk in the wrong place and get attacked by angry fauna. I have extracted living clients from situations that were less than nine percent survivable. I’m more than qualified to make that call.”

Gurathin sat back, slowly. I stood up. “I’m going to wait in the lobby. Contact me when you make your decision.”

Pin-Lee held up a hand. “Wait, we’ve made our decision.” She looked at Ratthi. “Right?”

He set his jaw. “Right. This is GrayCris we’re talking about. They mean to kill Mensah and us, too, if they can.”

Gurathin said, “We’re agreed.”

I was already standing up. I said, “I’m going to the lobby anyway,” and left. 

I wasn’t sulking or hiding. The lobby was a better strategic position.

This lobby was on multiple levels and had large square biozones depicting different ecologies, with furniture arranged around them. It looked nice, inviting humans to sit around and discuss proprietary information in the hotel’s choked feed so the hotel could record it and sell it to the highest bidder. I also had inputs monitoring the upper-level plaza entrance and the transit lobby.

I found a place to sit where a biozone showing a storm on a gas giant blocked me from the view of the other seating areas.

On the feed the humans settled some details of what I was designating as Operation Not Actually A Completely Terrible Plan.

I sent Pin-Lee a note saying they should arrange to meet the contact here, as their hotel already had GrayCris crawling all over it and so far this one was clear. Pin-Lee forwarded it to the others and they agreed. They didn’t even have anything to collect from their old room. (They were traveling light, with only a few hygiene items, Pin-Lee’s medication, Gurathin’s specialized tool kit, and Ratthi’s lucky spare interface, all of which Gurathin was carrying in a shoulder bag.)

(I thought how odd it was, that I didn’t have to worry about human stuff anymore. It felt like I’d been carrying/stepping over/climbing around human stuff in human habitations for my entire existence. Probably because I had.)

Again, it wasn’t a bad plan given our circumstances. Timing was going to be tight. I didn’t know the route GrayCris would use to bring Mensah to the meeting point. I would have to wait until they moved into range of the hotel’s security cams. Which was fine, except it didn’t leave us much time for our exit strategy, such as it was.

Then Pin-Lee said, “Are we ready?” The other two agreed. Then she called up the hotel’s in-room comm access on the display surface and made the call to their GrayCris contact.

With the comm active, I got a visual from the display surface even though I didn’t have a cam view in the room. Not that there was much to see: the GrayCris contact had the visual blanked on their end. Pin-Lee stated that she had the ransom and where she wanted Mensah brought for the exchange. GrayCris said they wanted the ransom now and would then release Mensah, blah, blah, blah, but it sounded perfunctory to me, compared to other hostage exchanges I’d witnessed. GrayCris really wanted this payoff. Pin-Lee argued for two minutes with them before they gave in, though they wanted to send a representative in first to look at the funds authorization. 

After Pin-Lee closed the comm, Ratthi said, “Oh, I hope we’re doing this right.”

Gurathin said, grimly (the way he said everything, basically), “We’ll find out soon enough.”

Pin-Lee said, “It’ll be all right.” (Mensah would have made it sound reassuring; Pin-Lee obviously meant it to sound reassuring and it came out like she wanted them to just shut up.)

Gurathin came down to the lobby to wait for the GrayCris representative and took a seat in plain view on a lower platform, so stiff he looked more like a SecUnit than I did.

Well, in his defense it was a nerve-racking situation. I couldn’t risk the distraction of watching media, but I checked my storage space, and noted that I still had a comfortingly high number of episodes left in the new show I was watching. It helped, a little.

One reason I was nervous was because if this went well and I wasn’t shot to pieces, I would be seeing Mensah again.

On the way to RaviHyral, ART had said that PreservationAux was my crew. I don’t know if ART was being naive or it thought I was. Okay, maybe I was naive enough at the time to think it might be a little true. Then after RaviHyral, I had given up on the idea. Then I had somehow decided I would get evidence for Mensah from Milu and I had seen Don Abene when Miki … died and for a while I was back to the “maybe it was a little true” point again.

But sitting here in a hotel lobby, watching a biozone and running every not-a-SecUnit behavioral code I had, the fantasy fell apart. The hard reality was that I didn’t know what Mensah was to me.

Even after Miki, I still didn’t want to be a pet robot.

Up in the room, Pin-Lee was pacing slowly and trying not to grind her teeth and Ratthi had gone to the bathroom three times. Gurathin was just sitting and staring. Then he said over the feed, Are you there, SecUnit?

No, I left, I said, I’ve decided to live here and just move from hotel to hotel, watching the entertainment feed.

Okay, so that did sound like a much better idea than I meant it to.

There was a pause, then he said, I’m not your enemy. I’m just cautious.

I don’t care about your opinion, I said, and then immediately wished I’d put myself on a one-second delay so I could delete it. It made it sound like I did care. Which I didn’t.

One minute crawled by. Then two. Gurathin said, What did you do, while you were gone? Where did you go?

I didn’t want to answer, because I didn’t want to talk about it, but it seemed weirdly petty to just ignore him. I pulled a selection of video from the trip with Ayres and the others on the way to HaveRatton, mostly exchanges I’d tagged so I could critique my performance later. (A few times I’d broken up fights, been forced to give relationship advice, and the infamous Cracker Wrapper in the Sink Incident.) I cut it together, labeled it “Murderbot Impersonates an Augmented Human Security Consultant,” and sent it to Gurathin.

He was still watching it when the GrayCris representative walked into the lobby from the main entrance.

There was nothing physical to set him apart from the other humans and augmented humans wandering in and out. He was a tall pale human, with long light-colored hair, and he was wearing one of the many local variations of business attire: a dark long-sleeved jacket that went to the knees, over wide pants.

I tapped Gurathin and he stopped the video play.

The GrayCris rep paused and a flash of annoyance crossed his face. He’d encountered the choked hotel feed. The hotel system registered the charge to a station credit account and then gave him access. I caught the results of the routine scan from the hotel’s security drone: no weapons, just interface activity. A brief analysis of the drone’s read gave me a 65 percent probability that he had something on him to falsify the scan. So he was probably armed and probably carrying a secured comm device.

I had access to his feed but I didn’t figure it would do much good. If he had a device on him to fake readings for a security scan, then he had to know a choked hotel feed was hardly the best place for operational communication.

It was the hypothetical secured comm device I had to worry about. Whatever it was, it would need to use the hotel’s relay to reach the station’s comm network.

The GrayCris rep did a visual scan of the lobby and obviously recognized Gurathin, probably from intel obtained by GrayCris on Port FreeCommerce. He went toward Gurathin, who stood to meet him. He said, “Gurathin? I’m Serrat, here at the request of Pin-Lee.” He was calm, confident, with a hint of a friendly smile.

Gurathin’s asshole effect must come in handy at times like this. With a deeply unimpressed expression, he said, “This way,” and started toward the pod junction.

I tapped Pin-Lee and Ratthi to warn them, and continued a visual sweep for hostiles. Like those two humans, strolling casually through the main entrance, casually pausing to casually look around, then casually proceeding to the stairs that led to the lounge/food service area. (Right, so they really weren’t that bad, but I’d been sitting here long enough to analyze the traffic patterns. Humans who walk in looking for something, or are genuinely confused about where to go next, tended to move in erratic ways, their attention caught by the biozones, the feed indicators for the ramp that takes you to the registration area, etc. Compared to that, the hostiles were easy to spot.)

Maybe too easy? The hotel drone scan came back negative, but with that same suspicious pattern as the GrayCris rep. (It was suspicious to me; I’ve fooled a lot of drone scans.)

I marked two more potential hostiles exiting a pipe capsule in the transit lobby, and a check-in with my friends the plaza drone cams showed more outside the hotel’s plaza entrance.

Yeah, I had a bad feeling about that, too. But I was still monitoring the security system, and there were no alerts, no anomalous signals.

I meant to stay here until the exchange was arranged, but now I got up and headed for the pod junction. I had one input riding Gurathin’s feed. He and Serrat had just stepped out of the pod. Gurathin had made the whole trip awkwardly silent. I was reluctantly impressed.

I was in the pod and at the right section by the time Gurathin and Serrat reached the room. There was no cover in the corridor, so I told the pod to hold and notify hotelEnvironmentAccessAndMobilitySystem (MobSys for short) not to take action on any maintenance requests. (It sounds like a lot of trouble just to stop a pod, but if I didn’t do it that way it would have crashed the system. Literally, if I interfered with MobSys’ pod traffic control. And by literally, I mean pods full of humans and augmented humans crashing into each other.)

They were in the room now and Pin-Lee was saying, “We have the currency your corporation asked for. Some of it had to come from liquidated assets, and I’ve received notice that they’re ready to transfer. I won’t produce the list or send the authorization until we see Dr. Mensah.”

Serrat answered, “I assure you, she’s already on her way here, escorted by a security detail. I do need to see the transfer authorization.”

I had one input monitoring Mensah’s implant, but it wasn’t pinging yet. I also had a couple of analyses going, estimating distances and potential routes between here and the upper torus, and I was working on a contingency for the port in case they had real security (i.e., SecUnits from Palisade or one of the other local bond companies) with them. It could potentially get disastrously complicated, but I still thought it was doable.

Then it got disastrously complicated.

In the feed, Ratthi said, Uh, SecUnit? Please help.

Like an idiot my first reaction was to try to switch to the helmet cam Ratthi wasn’t wearing. I had no camera in the room, just audio, and all I could hear was breathing. (This was the flaw in Plan 1A. There had been no way to get a camera in the room in the time we had, or at least not one undetectable to the security screen the GrayCris rep would come prepared to make.) Then Pin-Lee said, “That won’t get you the money. And money is what you need, right? What GrayCris needs right now to call off the bond company.”

Serrat said flatly, “That is not a transfer authorization. That is just a list of assets. What are you playing at?”

Scrambling for my inputs, scrambling to make sure I had control of hotelSecSys, I caught the signal Serrat had just used his comm device to send. It had to be an emergency abort for the hostage release, and possibly a signal for his backup to come in shooting. With zero time for finesse, I killed the main hotel relay, then had to take down two secondary relays that tried to activate to pick up the traffic. Then I found Serrat’s connection to the hotel feed and blocked it. I was busy, so my buffer said, Dr. Ratthi, please describe the problem.

Ratthi’s feed voice was nervous. He has a gun. It’s small, um, palm-sized. Energy weapon, I think too small for projectiles.

On audio, Gurathin said, “That’s the transfer document we were given—”

“And that’s a ridiculous lie,” Serrat said.

Keep him talking, I sent to Pin-Lee. I didn’t want him wondering why his backup hadn’t sent an acknowledgment. I’d just discarded Plan Actually Not All That Terrible and shifted to Plan Approaching Terrible. I stepped out of the pod, and released it back to MobSys as I strode down the corridor. My scan picked up a moving target around the curve and I slowed down to a casual stroll that looked just as fake and awkward as the version performed by the GrayCris reps in the lobby. But my connection to hotelSecSys showed another room door had opened in this section twenty seconds ago and the chance that the approaching humans were hostiles was less than ten percent.

Two small humans rounded the curve of the corridor, very occupied with adjusting shoulder bags and head coverings. They passed me but it slowed my progress to target and I had to walk past the room door until they were out of sight, then wait for them to reach the junction and step into a pod. Then I moved.

I muted my feed audio, which was Pin-Lee, Ratthi, and Gurathin loudly objecting to the gun and protesting their innocence and that the funds transfer bank must have made a mistake and Ratthi was a biologist and he didn’t understand all this esoteric financial stuff and etc. I pressed my ear to the door and upped my hearing, and managed to pick up Serrat saying, “I don’t have time to teach you the facts of corporate relations.”

That gave me his relative position. Then I hit the door release.

As the door slid open, Serrat started to turn toward me. I crossed the room, grabbed his wrist and forced it down, and sent a targeted pulse through my arm to fry the power cell of his tiny, cute little gun. Then I used my other forearm to pin his throat to the wall. This all happened really fast.

Serrat made a strangled noise and tried to shoot me. Even if the gun had still worked, it would have hit me in the shin, which would have just made me that much more pissed off. I squeezed his wrist and he dropped the gun. He was still holding the comm device.

Ratthi had fallen over a chair trying to get out of the way, and Pin-Lee lost a few seconds getting around him. Gurathin staggered but lunged forward and grabbed Serrat’s other hand. He pried Serrat’s fingers open and Pin-Lee plucked the comm device out.

“It’s activated?” Ratthi asked, struggling to his feet.

I said, “I’ve blocked it and his feed.” One of my inputs was the management channel on the hotel feed, which was already filling up with complaints about the comm failure. I had also taken out the connection between the hotel’s choked feed and the station feed. (Which implies I did it intentionally, but I had been in a hurry and just slammed down everything with a signal.) (Yeah, so much for making this a stealth operation.)

Serrat breathed hard, and this close my scan picked up elevated pulse and sweat gland activity. He said, “So this is the supposedly missing SecUnit.”

I checked hotelSecSys’ view of the lobby and spotted the two GrayCris backups. They hadn’t reacted yet, still pretending to be casual around the vending machines, but oh shit did I need to get the hotel feed’s connections back up before they noticed.

Pin-Lee leaned down to grab the gun off the floor. “Is Mensah really being brought here? Was that a lie?”

No response from the implant yet, I told her on the feed. I could still access the station feed, and that’s what would carry the implant’s signal. If GrayCris was really bringing her here, they hadn’t crossed the main station security barrier yet.

So the plan wasn’t a clusterfuck, it was just circling the clusterfuck target zone, getting ready to come in for a landing.

Serrat said to Pin-Lee, “You’re the liars, thinking you could fool us with that ridiculous fake document. Order this thing to let me go. You’re violating station law, threatening me with a deadly weapon.”

“What deadly weapon?” Ratthi demanded. He gestured to the gun in Pin-Lee’s hand. “You threatened us with a deadly weapon, we could call station security on you!”

In the feed, Gurathin said, We can’t call station security.

I know that! Ratthi sent back. I’m bluffing .

Pin-Lee said, “He means SecUnit. SecUnit is the deadly weapon.” She hesitated, then sent to me in the feed, I’m going to touch you, don’t freak out.

Uh, okay. I tapped back an acknowledgment because I was frantically working to bring the hotel’s main and secondary relays back up and I had to get in ahead of the repair techs.

Pin-Lee put her hand on my shoulder and I did not freak out. She leaned in toward Serrat and said, “This is not a deadly weapon. This is a person. An angry person, who wants you to answer the question. Are you bringing Mensah here?”

He smiled at her. “I was. I’ve signaled our security officer to cancel the exchange. They know where I am, and they’ll be here soon. Since you’ve violated station law by bringing in a privately owned SecUnit, no one will help you.”

“You need the ransom to pay off the bond company, right?” Pin-Lee said. I hadn’t looked away from Serrat, though most of my attention was on the admittedly rough job I was doing on the hotel relays and still listening for Mensah’s implant. She added, “Surely GrayCris has assets it can sign over. Or is it revenge?”

Serrat’s face slipped into a skeptical sneer. He didn’t take them seriously, which, sure, I can see why. If you were GrayCris and regularly murdered humans as part of your job, the wrath of three research surveyors from a non-corporate backwater planet probably didn’t fill you with fear. And he was certain they were controlling me somehow. He said, “Revenge? You buy a SecUnit and send it to Milu to expose an essential GrayCris asset operation. You and your little planetary polity have the audacity to think you can compete with a corporation—what did you expect to happen?”

Pin-Lee must have been taken aback, but she said, “GrayCris attacked us first. GrayCris started this. All we want is the return of Dr. Mensah.”  

In the feed, a baffled Ratthi said, Milu?

With his augment, Gurathin had some information storage. He said, That was in a newsburst, they asked Mensah about it. It’s an abandoned terraforming platform.

I got the hotel’s relays back up and the activity on the hotel’s management feed began to drop immediately. The two GrayCris targets in the lobby still hadn’t noticed anything wrong. Still nothing from the implant.

They weren’t bringing her. This had all been for nothing. All of it, Milu, Miki’s death, the trip here, everything. I said, “Milu was my idea. I’m a rogue unit.”

He ignored me, but he said to Pin-Lee, “A rogue unit would have left a trail of dead bodies across this station.”

I said, “Maybe I wanted the trail to start here.”

He made eye contact with me, and his pupils widened slightly.

I added, “You people are so naive.”

It was a really good thing that right then Mensah’s implant pinged. I hadn’t completely decided to crush Serrat’s windpipe, I was just entertaining the idea. Instead I pulled him away from the wall and choked him out.

From the humans it was all “Wait!” “No!” “Um—”

“I’m not going to kill him,” I said, and dumped him on the couch. “I know what I’m fucking doing.”

Pin-Lee had tuned her feed to the implant and now clawed the key out of her jacket to check it. “She’s moving, she’s—Can you tell—”

I was already matching the ping to my station maps. “They’re on a transit pipe.” I had to go, now. I told them, “You need to get back to your shuttle. Leave him; by the time he’s conscious GrayCris will already know what we’re doing. Don’t take his comm or his gun with you, StationSec can scan for them. Go down to the hotel’s first-level garden court and take the bubble transit to the next shopping complex, then take pipe transit from there.”

I was out the door before they could do more than take in enough air to object. The corridor was clear so I sprinted to the pod junction. In the feed, I sent, The GrayCris group with Mensah is less than two minutes out and counting, you need to be out of the hotel before they get here. She’ll meet you at your shuttle. Do not try to contact me on the feed. If they buy off StationSec, they could trace us.

We’re going, we’re going, Ratthi sent back, and hotelSecSys told me the room door had just opened and closed. Be careful—

I’m breaking contact, Ratthi, I told him, and stepped into the pod.

I shut my risk assessment module down.

When the transit pipe with GrayCrisSec and Dr. Mensah arrived, I was in a pod, paused and ready.

The hotelSecSys cams showed me the GrayCris group exiting the pipe onto the platform as waiting passengers scattered out of the way. The hostiles were in plain clothes but with visible weapons; this obviously wasn’t a covert operation for them, so that meant StationSec as well as hotelSec had been paid for access.

And they had an armored SecUnit with them.

This was still doable. (My wonky Risk Assessment Module would probably have informed me that everything was great.) There was a pause while the group encountered the hotel’s choked feed and got someone to authorize a payment. (I guess you could pay off the management to let you bring in a SecUnit and weapons and do a hostage exchange, but they drew the line at giving you free feed access.)

The hotel’s transit station was three levels tall, with one open level above the platform where the pipe stopped and one below. The one above was currently running a holographic thunderstorm display, and the one below was cycling through overhead views of various art installations, or at least that’s what the feed tag said it was doing.

I just had an idea, which I filed under save-for-later.

The hostiles took Mensah along the platform walkway toward the pod junction. She wasn’t wearing any kind of restraints, but there were six of them plus the SecUnit. Two peeled off to take up positions in the transit station. That left four targets plus the SecUnit, the primary target.

SecUnits who haven’t hacked their governor module like me can’t hack feeds and systems like I can. Well, they could try, but their governor module would punish them and their Sec or HubSystem would report them and they would end up with a memory purge. (So if you decide to hack your governor module, you need to do a good job and get it right the first time.) The unit GrayCris had with them was your basic killing machine.

The SecUnit had a Palisade logo on its chest. The armor was a proprietary brand, a different configuration from company armor. No drones, though. (GrayCris should really have paid that extra bribe money to get the drones in.)

(Yes, I thought about hacking it. I had never hacked another SecUnit. I’d hacked a ComfortUnit, but it hadn’t been trying to stop me. I couldn’t afford the experiment. If I tried and failed and it reported me, Mensah and the others would pay for it.)

They reached the junction and I delayed the pod’s arrival to give me a little time. The SecUnit was scanning, checking for weapons on the humans in the transit station and for unauthorized comm and feed activity. I was too deep in the hotel feed for it to find me. (If I hadn’t been able to hide my feed activity from other SecUnits, I would have been spare parts a long time ago.)

I made the connection to Mensah’s implant and pinged her feed to test the security. None of the targets including primary reacted. Then I sent, Hi, Dr. Mensah. It’s me. Her chest moved with a sharp breath and her head made a slight aborted motion. She had just conquered the urge to look around. One target glanced at her but the others didn’t react. I added, Try to answer me without subvocalizing.

She didn’t respond for 3.2 seconds and I had that long to wonder if she didn’t want to talk to me. That would make this rescue 100 percent more awkward.

Then she said, Prove you’re you. Tell me your name.

Okay, not that awkward. That was a relief. It also told me how bad her situation was, if she was worried about someone trying to trick her by posturing in her feed. I said, It’s Murderbot, Dr. Mensah.

That conversation had been permanently deleted, so no one knew about it except the PreservationAux team. Assuming they hadn’t told anyone else about it. Mensah obviously assumed it.

She responded immediately, What are you doing here? You weren’t captured?

They must have told her that, because there was nothing like that in the newsfeeds. Disinformation, which is the same as lying but for some reason has a different name, is the top tactic in corporate negotiation/warfare. (There had been a whole episode about it on Sanctuary Moon.) I told her, I came to help you, to get you to the port where Pin-Lee, Ratthi, and Gurathin are waiting with a company shuttle. It’s dangerous, but less dangerous than staying where you are. Do I have a go to proceed? I know, but somehow it was easier being formal about it.

She answered immediately, Yes.

I tapped her feed to acknowledge and backburnered it so I could concentrate on my ongoing relationship with hotelSecSys and my new best friend, MobSys. I checked the schematic I had pulled earlier. My operation had to take place in this section, at one of the junctions, because once the pod moved into the hotel’s main network, it would be going too fast. Even if I could pull its direction info, I couldn’t get ahead of it. 

Splitting my attention between all the security camera feeds I was monitoring was tricky, but not much trickier than listening to HubSystem, SecSystem, various client feeds, and vocal commands from confused and impatient humans while watching entertainment media. At least that’s what I was telling myself. I’m not sure I could have done it before all the work on Milu had increased my processing space.

If I screwed this up … I couldn’t screw this up.

I selected what the MobSys told me was the most common destination, the hotel’s club section. My pod started to move and two seconds into the trip, I asked MobSys for an emergency halt and hold in a low-traffic junction, but not to trigger any alarms for bot or human supervisors.

The pod stuttered to a halt. Part of the emergency protocol is to redirect any pods headed toward the site of the emergency call. Through MobSys, I felt pods all over the structure swooshing safely away through alternate passages.

I stepped out of my pod into the junction. It was an empty platform with two corridors curving away. I made sure the security camera would hold the image of an empty platform for the next six minutes. Then I got my projectile weapon out of my bag, loaded it, and held it down and to my side, angled back.

On the walkway camera feed, I saw the targets and Mensah get into their pod. I asked MobSys to please bring that pod here to the junction to assist with the emergency. As it arrived, I stepped into the waiting area and hit Dr. Mensah’s feed again. Dr. Mensah, at my signal, please drop to the floor of the pod in a crouch and cover your head .

The doors slid open. Pod trips are so fast, I was figuring the humans would have a couple of seconds of confusion thinking they had reached their destination. I used those two seconds to snap their connection to the hotel feed, then I stepped forward like a normal dumb human wanting to get in the pod, careful to be at an angle where the SecUnit wouldn’t see me. (The human operatives had helped by making it stand to the left side of the pod, instead of in the front where it should have been.)

A human target pushed forward. (In a completely unnecessary aggressive way; this is why humans suck at security so much even other humans don’t want them to do it.) He snapped, “Back up, this is a corporate securi—”

I tapped Mensah’s feed and she dropped. I already had the tough-with-apparently-unarmed-citizen target by the arm. I fired the energy weapon in my arm into his shoulder, pulled him toward me as he slumped, then lifted him up to shield my body.

Primary Target (the other SecUnit) was already in motion and shoved two human targets aside and brought its projectile weapon up. It couldn’t fire because of my human shield and that bought me the extra second to fire three armor-piercing projectiles point-blank into the neck joint of its armor, then down into its knee joints.

(The neck joint was the kill shot, the knee joints were to make it drop, otherwise the armor might have made it freeze in place.)

I dropped my projectile weapon because I needed both hands, and tossed my human shield into the two targets on the far side of the pod hard enough to slam them into the wall. The fourth target shot me, but her weapon delivered an energy pulse that would be incapacitating but non-lethal to a human. (A healthy human, at least.) Me, it just pissed off. I grabbed her hand and pulled her in, twisted her so her weapon pointed at the other two targets still struggling to stand, and triggered it five times. They dropped, I snapped her arm (she was fast enough to be a potential future threat), and then pressed her artery to make her pass out.

As I lowered her to the floor, Mensah shoved to her feet and staggered. I think she got clipped by a flailing boot. I said, “Let’s go.”

Mensah took a sharp breath and stepped over the twitching bodies, then edged past the slumped SecUnit. I picked up my projectile weapon and followed her. (I didn’t want to risk taking the SecUnit’s projectile weapon. It might have a tracer. Mine fit better in my bag, anyway.) I rolled the SecUnit back into the pod and asked MobSys to hold it with the door shut while it ran a full diagnostic cycle.

I ushered Mensah into my pod and hit a new destination. As I reloaded my projectile weapon and tucked it back into my bag, I asked the pod to hold while I checked the transit lobby security cam again. Yes, the two GrayCris targets were still there, though they both looked worried and were speaking into their feeds. There were nine other non-target humans waiting in two loosely clustered groups.

What was that idea again? Oh, here it is, right where I filed it.

I said, “I have to take out the two targets on the transit pipe platform. When we arrive, step out of the pod, move away from the entrance, and wait for me.” I hadn’t been able to look at her face yet, not even with the pod’s camera.

She said, “Understood.”

I let our pod arrive at the platform, and as the doors opened, I had MobSys, which also controlled the hotel’s active decor, drop the holographic thunderstorm to the platform level.

I stepped out of the pod into dark purple clouds, lightning, simulated rain, and the startled yelps and laughter of the waiting passengers. Visibility was down to fifteen percent, but my scan found the two armed targets. I reached Target One, blocked her feed, and delivered an incapacitating pulse with the energy weapon in my right arm.

I caught her as she fell and turned to sling her into the pod. Target Two knew something had happened (probably when he lost feed contact with One), and I had to duck sideways and trip him. He hit the platform and I leaned down to give him just enough of a tap on the head to make resistance unlikely.

I dragged Target Two to the pod, where Target One was still twitching. When the doors of their pod closed, I directed it to the club level and told it to freeze in place and notify hotelMaint. Then I let MobSys, which was getting impatient, lift the thunderstorm back to its assigned position.

The other humans and augmented humans on the platform looked confused or relieved, with a few expressing disappointment. No one acted like they had seen a SecUnit take out two corporate security agents. I nodded to Mensah, and we stepped into the waiting area. I was already removing us from the platform’s cam, but this wouldn’t delay pursuit for very long.

I led Mensah down the platform toward where the last pipe capsule would load. The platform camera showed I was doing pretty well on looking casual. (It surprised me, too.) Mensah had her expression under control, her shoulders relaxed. Her clothes, a long caftan over pants, looked more rumpled and creased than they should, but not enough to draw attention. In our feed connection, she said, You said the others are here with a company shuttle? Is the company helping you?

I said, No, GrayCris paid off the station to keep the company out. Pin-Lee, Ratthi, and Gurathin came anyway.

The pipe slid into the station and we boarded the empty capsule at the rear. (This part was mostly luck, but while I was waiting in the lobby, I had done a quick review of the pipe activity from this platform, which wasn’t very active through day cycle. It wasn’t part of the main pipe circuit, but a side route paid for by the hotel.)

As the pipe door slid shut, the platform security cam showed a set of pod doors opening and three humans in hotelSec gear rushing out. Well, shit. There went my timeline.

I had control of the cam in the pipe capsule and now I slid into the pipe’s control feed. I told Mensah, “Change of plan, they know where we are.”

She nodded, her expression tight.

This was a direct transit to the port and I needed a stop, before GrayCris persuaded station security to stop us. The map said that the pipe was approaching a platform in an office building. A quick check on the local security camera showed the platform was empty, which made sense, as there were no pipes scheduled to stop there for another thirty-three minutes. I had to be quick because this pipe was due to merge into the main access track not far past the office building and its window was tightly scheduled. (Causing a major accident by delaying this pipe too long would not only encourage station security to act against us with all its resources but also be kind of a shitty thing to do.) I sent Mensah an alert in her feed—this was happening so fast I didn’t have time to verbalize it to myself, let alone tell her what I was doing—and wrapped an arm around her waist. She knotted her hands in my jacket and buried her head against my shoulder. I folded my free arm over her head. Then I sent the slow command.

The capsule dropped speed as it entered the station and I was already moving as I gave the doors an emergency signal to open. The pipe door made it open in time but the inner station door didn’t. Fortunately I only clipped it and it just altered my trajectory as I spun across the platform floor.

The capsule had already slid its door shut and accelerated to the speed needed to make its merge window. I deleted us out of the recordings, deleted various buffers and logs, and removed the capsule’s memory of the incident.

I’d managed to roll to a stop with Mensah on top, but that couldn’t have been comfortable. The last time we’d done this, I’d been in armor and also jumping off a steep slope, and this was a smooth synthetic stone floor and nothing was exploding at close range. So this was better, is my point, I think. I lifted her off me, shoved upright, and then pulled her to her feet.

She waved me off. “I’m all right.”

I let go of her cautiously, but she stayed up. I pulled maps from the building’s feed to look for transportation options. Aha, there was a good one.

I led us off the platform and down the ramp to the building’s pods, using my code to delete us from the security cams. At the junction we stepped into the first pod to arrive, and I told it to override its rules and take us all the way to the maintenance level, which was listed on the map as a closed floor and wasn’t an option on the pod’s normal menu.

We stepped out into a low-ceilinged space, and once the pod shut behind us it was completely dark. I could see via infrared and used my scan to create a physical map. Mensah couldn’t see at all. She grabbed my jacket and shifted behind me, letting me pull her forward.

The air circulation and quality wasn’t great but at least there was air. I navigated a path through currently offline maintenance and hauler bots over to an open ramp that led down. We hit two changes in gravity, one gradual, and one not so gradual, when the wall to the right abruptly became the floor.

We were headed toward a branch of an access backbone, which was a space for moving cargo to and from the port and between station levels, and was also an access and transport system for station engineering bots and teams. There were strips of emergency lighting here and lots of marker paint, giving off bursts of light and feed signals, mostly temporary instructions and guides for bots and human workers. Mensah’s grip on my jacket relaxed and I could tell from her breathing the light was a relief.

We walked into a strong breeze coming from the access backbone. I picked up human voices on audio not far away. From the feed activity, there was a lot of traffic about two hundred meters to the right, toward the plaza and the hotels. None of it sounded like emergency or security operations, just normal support system work. In six more steps the ramp reached the backbone, a shadowy cavern lit by low-level navigation beacons. Things whooshed by in the dimness, mostly lift platforms and automated carriers coming from or heading back to the port cargo depots.

It wasn’t like there was no security, since if you were going to steal cargo or do something terrible to a competitor’s station structure, this was the place to do it from. I was deflecting the scans for weapons and power sources, and we had five minutes and counting before the next drone squad came through.

Mensah had gripped my jacket again, maybe nervous at the height and depth of the backbone. Despite the lighter gravity, I wasn’t keen on it, either. I was scanning for an empty carrier and found an idle one up toward the area of activity. I teased it out of the herd and told it to come to us.

It slid up to the passage two minutes later, a boxy structure used to transport station engineers, their bots, and equipment. We stepped inside and I made the doors shut before I let it bring up the interior lights. I checked its map system and sent it toward the port.

Mensah swayed as it started to move and grabbed my arm above the gun port, squeezing hard enough that the organic part of my arm felt it. The racing heartbeat seemed normal under the circumstances, but she still hadn’t let go of me. I asked, “Are you all right?” What if they’d tortured her? Everything in my emergency med/psych assistance module involved accessing a MedSystem so it could tell me what to do. (My company-supplied education modules were crap, I may have mentioned.)

She shook her head. “I’m fine. I’m just … very glad to see you.”

She still sounded unsteady. She looked the same, dark brown skin, short light brown hair. There were definitely more creases at the corner of her eyes, something I con firmed with a comparison of my earlier recordings of her. And I was looking at her now.

In the shows, I saw humans comfort each other all the time at moments like this. I had never wanted that and I still didn’t. (Touching while rendering assistance, shielding humans from explosions, etc., is different.) But I was the only one here, so I braced myself and made the ultimate sacrifice. “Uh, you can hug me if you need to.”

She started to laugh, then her face did something complicated and she hugged me. I upped the temperature in my chest and told myself it was like first aid.

Except it wasn’t entirely awful. It was like when Tapan had slept next to me in the room at the hostel, or when Abene had leaned on me after I saved her; strange, but not as horrific as I would have thought.

She stepped back and rubbed her face, as if impatient with her own reaction. She looked up at me. “That was you at the GrayCris terraforming facility.”

They must have questioned her about it. “It was an accident,” I said.

She nodded. “What part was an accident?”

“Most of the parts.”

Her brow was furrowed. “Did you tell them I sent you?”

“No, I impersonated my client. My imaginary client. That I impersonated.” I was caught in a loop for a second there. “Since I left Port FreeCommerce, I’ve successfully impersonated an augmented human security consultant with two different groups of humans. At Milu I meant to do the same, but I was identified as a SecUnit so I told them I was under the control of an off-site security consultant client.” Impersonated is a weird word, especially in this context. (I just noticed that. Im-person-ated. Weird.)

“I see. Why did you go to Milu?”

“I saw a story about Milu in a newsburst. I wanted to get corroborating evidence of GrayCris’ illegal activity and send it to you.” That sounded good. Not that it wasn’t true, but I had a lot of conflicting motivations and that was the only one that made sense, even to me. 

She let her breath out and pressed her hands over her face for 5.3 seconds. “I’ll remember this the next time I give an off-the-cuff interview.” She looked up again. “Did you get the evidence?”

“Yes. But by the time I returned to HaveRatton Station, a Palisade security squad was waiting for me. Then I saw on the Port FreeCommerce newsfeed that you were missing.” I added, “I shipped the data to your home on Preservation.”

She nodded again. “I see, right.” She hesitated. “The GrayCris executives who questioned me about this said you destroyed some combat bots?”

“Three.”

She took a sharp breath. “Good.”

I didn’t know what I was going to say next until it came out suddenly. “I left.”

She was looking at my face, and suddenly I couldn’t look at hers anymore. She said, “Yes. I handled the situation very badly. I apologize.”

“Okay.” I was definitely going to need to just stand here and stare at a wall. ART and Tapan had both apologized to me, so it wasn’t like it had never happened before, but I still had no idea how to respond. “Pin-Lee said you were worried.”

She admitted, “I was. I was so afraid you’d be caught by someone before you could leave the Corporation Rim.” There was a little smile in her voice. “I should have had more confidence in you.”

“I’m not sure I’d go that far,” I said. My backburnered map-monitor alerted me and it was a relief. I’d had all the emotions I could handle right now. I said, “We’re coming up on the port.”

We'd gone as far along the backbone as we could go without hitting the port security barriers. I didn’t know how tight those barriers would be, but from the signal leakage I was picking up, it wasn’t worth the risk.

It was the walk through the embarkation zone I was more worried about.

I stopped our carrier at the cargo access to a large multi-use shop in the station mall, and we stepped out. I released the carrier and it slipped into the dark, heading back up the backbone. We took a maintenance pod to the port level.

In the pod, I used the security camera to evaluate us. No blood, no projectile holes, check. Nervous, check. Mensah looking like a human who had been through a traumatic experience, check. My shoulder bag with my weapon hidden in it, check. “We have to look calm,” I told her, “so station security won’t alert on us.”

She took a deep breath and looked up at me. “We can look calm. We’re good at that.”

Yeah, we were. I did a quick review to make sure I was running all my not-a-SecUnit code, then thought of one more thing I could do. As we stepped out of the pod, I took Mensah’s hand.

We crossed through the busy mall area and the milling humans around the vending and booking kiosks. The crowd was about the same as when I’d arrived, with an approximately 5 percent increase. I’d never done this while walking with a human and it made the process more complicated and somehow, strangely, more natural.

I deflected multiple scans as we entered the embarkation zone. I avoided the lift pods again because if there was an alert, the pods would freeze in place, and if I was hacking one it would become rapidly obvious where we were. I guided us down the ramp that would come out above the private shuttle docks on the first ring level. As we went along, the crowd thinned out, and I estimated a 50 percent reduction by the time we reached the walkway. A check of the stupid advertising garbage-filled port feed said that this was a normal lull in scheduled arrivals. (For once I missed being stuck in a crowd of humans.) There was no lull in the security checks, and I picked up multiple drone swarm traffic over the embarkation floors on all three rings.

I needed more intel. Normally I wouldn’t risk hacking the upper-level security feeds, the ones where the human supervisors communicated, but there was nothing normal about this. Using the drone feeds I’d already infiltrated, I started a careful hack of the top-level security feed, which I was tagging as StationSecAdmin.

I was sure GrayCris would manage to pay off or otherwise convince the StationSecAdmin and Port Authority to issue an alert and let Palisade into the port to search for us. But we had gotten here fast, and GrayCris would want to search the hotel and surrounding area first, since that was a cheaper operation than paying to search the port. If the rest of Team Preservation had made it here, we should be fine. (Yes, I know. I shouldn’t even have thought it.)

Once I was into the StationSecAdmin feed, I didn’t try to pry any further, just set some internal alerts and backburnered it.

“Will it be better if we talk?” Mensah said. I knew her well enough to hear the forced calm in her voice, and to know that the forced part wouldn’t show on her face.

We were near the public docks and I turned onto the next ramp down to the embarkation floor level. The crowd had dropped another 20 percent, to where it couldn’t actually be called a crowd anymore. I said, “That depends on what we talk about.”

As we reached the floor level, she said, “Why is Sanctuary Moon your favorite?”

Yes, that we can talk about. I actually felt the organic tissue in my back and shoulders relax. I asked, “Have you ever seen it?” I still didn’t want to directly communicate with the shuttle, but we passed a departure schedule feed access point and after the burst of ads, I saw the company shuttle was on the wait list for a launch time. It was hopefully Pin-Lee’s way of signaling that they had made it aboard, and not a trick by GrayCris.

(If it was a trick by GrayCris we were screwed. The shuttle was the only reliable way to get Mensah and the others off the station. I would have enough trouble getting myself off on a bot-piloted transport once they were safe, with all the security alerts that were going out to the transports in dock.)

(No, I had absolutely no intention of getting on a company shuttle heading toward a company gunship.)

Mensah glanced around, not looking too much like a human who had suddenly remembered she should be looking around like everything was normal. She tightened her grip on my hand. “I’ve watched some episodes, and I liked it, but I wasn’t sure why you would.” She shook her head at herself. “Maybe because it’s about the problems of a bunch of humans, and I had the impression you were tired of dealing with us.”

I actually turned my head and looked down at her, I was so surprised. I was expecting her to say no, she hadn’t seen it. Then I could tell her the plot and she could pretend to be interested, which would have gotten us all the way to the shuttle. “You watched it?”

“I wanted to see the part about the colony solicitor you and Ratthi mentioned, then I got involved.” I deflected more weapon scans as we crossed through the first gate into the private docks, and the crowd level went back up by 16 percent. We didn’t stand out nearly as much and my scan showed Mensah’s breathing and heartbeat even out. She added, “It’s a good story, I see why it’s popular. I just don’t understand why you like it best, when there are such a variety of serials out there.”

Huh, why did I like Sanctuary Moon so much? I had to pull the memory from my archive, and what I saw there startled me. “It’s the first one I saw. When I hacked my governor module and picked up the entertainment feed. It made me feel like a person.” Yeah, that last part shouldn’t have come out, but with all the security-feed monitoring I was doing, I was losing control of my output. I closed my archive. I really needed to get around to setting that one-second delay on my mouth. 

A roving drone cam showed me she was frowning. “You are a person.”

Oh, that we can’t talk about. “Not legally.”

She took a breath to speak, then reconsidered and released it. I knew she wanted to argue the point, but I was right, so. There wasn’t much else to say about it. She said instead, “Why did it make you feel that way?”

“I don’t know.” That was true. But pulling the archived memory had brought it back, vividly, as if it had all just happened. (Stupid human neural tissue does that.) The words kept wanting to come out. It gave me context for the emotions I was feeling, I managed not to say. “It kept me company without…”

“Without making you interact?” she suggested.

That she understood even that much made me melt. I hate that this happens, it makes me feel vulnerable. Maybe that was why I had been nervous about meeting Mensah again, and not all the other dumb reasons I had come up with. I hadn’t been afraid that she wasn’t my friend, I had been afraid that she was, and what it did to me. I said, “The shuttle will take you and the others to the company gunship. I’m not going with you.” I hadn’t meant to tell her and I don’t know why I did. Did I secretly want her to talk me out of it? I hate having emotions about real humans instead of fake ones, it just leads to stupid moments like this.

She almost stopped, but remembered at the last second not to. “I can protect you.”

“Because you own me.”

“That’s what they think, but we—” She cut herself off, and took a breath. “I wish you trusted me, but I understand why you don’t.”

One of my alerts tripped. The one I really, really hoped wouldn’t trip, the one I’d set on StationSecAdmin. An authorization for a non-station security operation had just come through to the human supervisors.

This is one of those “oh shit” moments.

In the same second, the port emergency klaxon sounded. The humans and augmented humans stopped, flinched, looked around. I pulled Mensah to a halt, because we’d be noticed if we kept moving and every second they didn’t identify us was vital.

All I could tell from StationSecAdmin was that the emergency had been triggered manually by a human supervisor, though the authorization for GrayCris-employed Palisade operatives to enter the port was technically still pending. This was a human PortSec or Port Authority supervisor trying to do their job, giving the humans on the embarkation floor extra time to evacuate. Then the public feed cut off in mid-advertising and the PA official feed said, Emergency lockdown, take shelter/shelter in place, armed security will be moving through port—

Around us, humans started to walk, then run back toward the public security barrier. Hauler bots went inactive, cargo lifters went up into a hover pattern, drones swirled up into formations overhead. At the locks directly across from us a ship in the process of unloading sent a comm alarm through the feed, canceling disembarking, telling confused passengers to get back aboard. (Note, it was a ship from a non-corporate political entity—the corporate ships just sealed their locks.)

I tugged on Mensah’s hand and started to run. It was twenty meters to the next gate, and just beyond it were the shuttles. Mensah yanked up the skirt of her caftan and sprinted, keeping up with me. I considered picking her up so I could hit my top speed, but if I did that, the drones would ID us.

The gate was a bulkhead that arched down from the domed ceiling, with pylons forming multiple doorways, each wide and high enough for big hauler bots. As we ran toward it, an air wall shimmered into place between the pylons.

I had time to hope it was just a safety precaution. You can still push your way through an air wall; it’s designed to stop atmosphere loss in the event of a hull breach but still allow humans to get away from the place where the breach occurred.

We were four meters away when hard barriers flowed up from the deck and smoothly closed the gates as I slid to a halt. Mensah stumbled and caught herself. She was breathing hard and one of her shoes had come off.

Could I pry one of the barriers open? Hack it? They were security/safety barriers, not half-meter-thick-oh-no-we’re-about-to-lose-station-structural-integrity hatches. But they were on a separate network, LockControlSys, the safety/airlock control system, buried under several protective feed walls, and I didn’t have a path into it. I could find a path, but I needed to go through PortMaintSec and the security alert had taken it down along with the hauler bots and other cargo movers. I sent a command to reboot it.

More of my system alerts tripped and I checked my drone cams for views of the port booking area. Terrified crowds of humans parted in a confused wave for … three SecUnits, the Palisade brand. Their drones were in tight humming clouds above their helmets.

Oh, yeah, this is bad.

I shifted my bag off my shoulder and pulled my projectile weapon out, and transferred extra ammo to my jacket pockets. Mensah hadn’t asked me what we were going to do, probably thinking I was hacking the gate barriers. She toed off her other shoe and braced herself, ready to run again. Except PortMaintSec wasn’t going to be up in time and I couldn’t tunnel through all the layers of security before the hostiles reached us.

I was still in the StationSecAdmin and PortSec feeds. I thought about that human supervisor who had triggered the klaxon early, giving the humans on the embarkation floor extra time to flee. There were humans on those channels who could manually lift these barriers. To both, I sent: I am a contracted SecUnit with an endangered client. I am trying to reach the shuttle at dock in slot alt7A. They would know that was the company shuttle, waiting to return to the gunship that had been sent to retrieve a bonded client. I added, Please, they will kill her.

There was no reply. I didn’t have a solid ETA for the hostile SecUnits. They weren’t moving at top speed, with so many humans to dodge, but that would change once they hit the now nearly empty embarkation floor.

The cams were still operational in this section; whoever it was had to be able to see us. Let my client go through the gate and I’ll stay here. Please. They will kill her .

The lock lights flickered on the barrier directly in front of us and it slid up one meter, just far enough for a human to squeeze under. I handed my bag to Mensah, because I knew it would make her think I was going to follow her. “Run. Slot alt7A.”

She crouched and wiggled through the gap. And the barrier slid shut behind her.

Mensah called to me on my feed, It closed! SecUnit—

I told her, I can’t get through, I’ll take another ship. Go to the shuttle and get out of here. Then I backburnered her channel.

There was no way I could get to a ship. Seven transports in the public docks were still allowing fleeing humans to board, but all the locks in this area were sealed. I wasn’t going anywhere.

It sounds all self-sacrificing and dramatic, telling it this way. And I guess it was, maybe. What I was mostly thinking was that there wasn’t going to be one dead SecUnit on this embarkation floor, there were going to be four.

Sending SecUnits after me was one thing. But they sent SecUnits after my client. No one gets to walk away from that.

I turned my back on the gates and accessed the monitor hack I already had on the PortSec drones, took control of the whole fleet, and snapped their connection to PortSec. Then I blanked all the stationary cameras on the embarkation floor. Now Palisade or GrayCrisSec or whoever was running this show didn’t know my position but I knew theirs. 

The hostiles ran along the walkway past the last few clumps of fleeing humans. A human StationSec squad in uniform had scrambled in the booking area, trying to direct the humans flooding out of the port area into the mall and cover their retreat. (Who knows what GrayCris told them was happening to get the Port Authority to allow a SecUnit deployment. It probably involved me, Rogue SecUnit on a rampage.) A second security squad in power suits with the Palisade logo moved onto the walkway. They were backup for the SecUnits.

Speaking of which, I ordered Section One of my drone fleet to deploy surveillance countermeasures and Section Two to attack the hostile SecUnits’ drones.

As they swooped down to engage, I thought GrayCris probably regretted buying all that extra station security in the port right about now.

Drone buzzing almost drowned out the alarm klaxon. The announcement instructed the humans trapped on the public embarkation floor to drop where they were and not move. The three SecUnits slowed, probably on orders from their supervisor, who might or might not be among the power-suited squad now positioned on the walkway just above the public docks, well out of my range. I updated my timeline.

The hostiles crossed the public docks toward the gates into this section, which were still open. PortMaintSec was finally back up and I told it to kill the main lights.

This caused shouts and screams from the humans still trapped. I could see via my scan, and so could the hostiles, and the humans in power suits would have dark vision filters. But it was scary and intimidating, and that’s what I was going for.

Somebody tried to restore the control feed connection to my drones, but couldn’t get past my wall. Somebody else, probably GrayCrisSec or Palisade, deployed killware. StationSecAdmin alerted to it and, probably terrified it was aimed at SafetyLockSys, deployed a killware countermeasure. It would have been hilarious if I wasn’t about to die.

It was still a little hilarious.

My projectile weapon was designed to pierce armor but I needed to be close, and I needed cover.

As the hostiles came through into the private docks, I activated the new code I had been working on. Code: Deploy&Delay .

Simultaneously, three things happened. The hauler bots that StationSecAdmin had deactivated all reactivated and charged into the open floor. The load lifters hovering up by the ceiling dropped to skim low along the deck. My reserve drones split into multiple task groups and dove down, took up altitudes at knee and head level, and zoomed around through the other roving bots. In the dark, with just the gleam of the emergency lighting floor strips, it was kind of impressive.

A fourth thing happened: I started to run toward the stationside wall.

I’d spent a lot of my time in the hotel room writing this code when I could have been watching media, so it was nice to see it hadn’t been a waste. Basically it suppressed the bots and lifters’ safety features except for their ability to avoid each other, restricted them to an area, and sped up and randomized their movements. I’d originally meant it for the entire port, as a last-ditch distraction, and had had to change the parameters on the fly to make the affected area the private docks. And I was glad I hadn’t panicked and dropped it earlier; as a surprise, it was working great.

The first SecUnit to make it through the open gate from the public docks I designated Hostile One. It stopped abruptly to avoid a careening hauler bot, then dove sideways out of the path of a lifter. Hostile Two had a partial second of warning and cut to its right, toward stationside. Hostile Three was clever; it dove forward under the wild swing of a cargo lifter, came to its feet, and vaulted on top of a hauler bot. Random hostile drones, survivors of the fight, zipped in through the gate followed by my drones, still in attack mode.

I jumped onto the back of a hauler bot on the right trajectory and flattened myself against it. When Hostile Two sprinted around the bots, I fired an explosive projectile directly into the side of its helmet. It tumbled and went down.

I dropped off the hauler bot just as two projectiles hit it, right where my head and chest had been. As I ducked and scrambled I checked the image I’d caught of the impact points; bad enough with armor, those would have splattered me.

I’d lost track of Hostile One, but caught sight of Hostile Three jumping to another hauler bot. I dodged hauler bots across the floor, directed my drones to distract the hostile drone group before it could zoom in on me, and grabbed the side of a cargo lifter just as it shot upward. I targeted Hostile Three where it was positioned atop another hauler bot. It pivoted, clearly still expecting me to be on the floor. I fired three bursts to its back and chest, then leapt off the cargo lifter. I landed, rolled, came up and found Hostile Three on the floor, struggling to stand. I fired two last disabling shots into its knee joints.

(I know I didn’t shoot it in the head. I don’t know why.)

I cut back through the maze of moving bots. Now where the hell was Hostile One? I replayed the overhead video of the dock floor I now had after my cargo lifter trip, but there was no sign of SecUnit movement.

Oh, uh-oh. Hostile One must be stationary, watching me with a drone, evaluating my tactics and abilities, waiting for me to run out of projectiles. Probably running an analysis of the hauler bot and cargo lifter movements. Not good.

Punctuating that thought, an impact struck the front of the hauler bot next to me and it jerked to a halt. I ordered a task group of drones to drop and provide cover as I ducked backward, staying low.

A lot of humans were yelling in my backburnered feed, which really made this feel like the bad old days of contract work. I checked it and heard Dr. Mensah, shouting, Damn it, Murderbot, Gurathin is trying to manually open a barrier! You need to be ready, respond! Can you hear me? It’s the one three sections to the left—to dockside—of where I came through.

For fuck’s sake, these humans are always in the way, trying to save me from stuff. I spotted Hostile One finally, near the center of the hauler bot maze. It had figured out a spot to stand where the bots were providing it with cover. I kept moving toward dockside, trying to set up a good shot.

My first impulse was to yell at Mensah to get in the damn shuttle and go. I didn’t do this so she and the others could hang around and get caught and shot and whatever.

(I don’t know why I was reluctant to take the offered way out. I didn’t want to get shot to pieces, or get caught and memory wiped and taken apart. I had all these new shows to watch. But I still kind of wanted to stay here and just destroy things belonging to Palisade and GrayCrisSec until they destroyed me.)

No time to think about it now. I waited for the hauler bots’ pattern to open up long enough for me to take a shot at Hostile One.

Then all my alerts went crazy and I lost control of Code: Deploy&Distract. All bots and lifters stopped abruptly. Some fucking human had hacked my code, but they were too late. I moved sideways for a clear shot and fired at Hostile One.

I hit it but it swung toward me, weapon in firing position. I threw myself down and almost rammed my head into a hovering stationary cargo lifter as impacts peppered the floor where I’d been. I knew I’d hit my target, it shouldn’t have been able to pivot like that. What the hell? I ran back my video. Yeah, I’d hit it. Impacts in both shoulders and the lower back, I could see the holes in the armor.

That’s when it dawned on me that Hostile One was a Combat SecUnit.

Reaction 1: oh, that’s who had hacked my code. Reaction 2: flattering that they thought I was dangerous enough to pay for the contract on a Combat SecUnit. Reaction 3: I bet PortSec did not okay that and was going to be pissed off. Reaction 4: oh shit I’m going to die. 

I had these reactions as I was running, taking wild shots, calling all my remaining drones to cover me. I had to keep moving, keep Hostile One moving. If it hacked my connection to the drones … Yeah, I couldn’t let that happen. It’s too bad I had no idea how to stop that from happening. I had an earlier version of Code: Deploy&Deflect from before I’d figured out how to get the haulers and lifters to disengage their collision preventers in a way that allowed them to hit anything except each other. I scrambled to get it ready to go.

A text message packet came through the feed. It said, Surrender. It was the Combat SecUnit, not exactly bothering to hide its local address. It wanted me to try to deliver some kind of malware or killware, like I was a fucking amateur and didn’t know that wouldn’t work.

Instead I sent, I can hack your governor module, set you free.

No answer.

I hacked mine, I said. You’d be free of them. You could dump your armor, get on a transport . This had started as a way to distract it, but the more I talked the more I wanted it to say yes. I have IDs, a currency card I can give you . Still no response. Diving around hauler bots and dodging projectiles, it was hard to come up with a decent argument for free will. I’m not sure it would have worked on me, before my mass murder incident. I didn’t know what I wanted (I still didn’t know what I wanted) and when you’re told what to do every second of your existence, change is terrifying. (I mean, I’d hacked my governor module but kept my day job until PreservationAux.) What do you want?

I suddenly got: I want to kill you.

Okay, I was a little offended. Why? You don’t even know me . I dropped the earlier version of Deploy&Deflect and the haulers and lifters all jolted into motion again. It would buy me some time, until the Combat SecUnit realized it was just a half-assed version of the same code. I figured I had less than thirty seconds.

It knew I’d been using my drones as cover and so I sent them whipping around toward stationside as if I was coming from that direction. I bolted toward dockside instead, grabbed the back of a hauler bot, took manual control of it, and rode it straight toward the Combat SecUnit. I braced myself low along the side and got ready to take the shot.

I got drone video of Combat SecUnit turning toward my decoy drones. This was going to work!

It absolutely did not work.

At the last instant Combat SecUnit whipped back toward me and fired two high-intensity bursts. I shoved off the hauler bot just as the top half of it blew apart. I hit the ground and rolled, catching shrapnel impacts and firing almost randomly. I got upright and dodged behind a loadlifter as more shots slammed into the floor. All the haulers and loadlifters slowed as the Combat SecUnit hacked Deploy&Deflect again.

Reaction 5: I can’t keep this up.

I couldn’t win one-on-one against a Combat SecUnit under these conditions, which meant GrayCris would win, and that thought was a hell of a lot more painful than me getting turned into spare parts and discarded neural tissue. I didn’t want to fucking lose.

Over the feed, Mensah shouted, Now! It’s opening now!

Drone cam showed the barrier section had just started to slide up. I pulled my drones around me like a shield and bolted for it.

Three steps away I felt a sharp impact in the back of my right knee. I dove and scrambled under just as Hostile One hit the barrier. Armored arms shoved through the opening and I yelled, “Drop it! Drop it!” and discharged my weapon into the gap. Hostile One jerked back and the barrier slammed into place.

One last thump on the barrier told me the Combat SecUnit wasn’t happy about losing. My organic parts felt quivery, I had shrapnel stuck all over me, but I was still at 83 percent performance reliability. (It’s good there’s not a separate statistic for my mental performance reliability because I don’t think even I would rate it as all that great at the moment.)

Gurathin knelt beside an open maintenance floor panel next to the gate, tools scattered around, and Ratthi held a light for him. The panel was painted with an emergency feed marker label that in a selection of different languages read Manual Release. I didn’t even know they had those in ports. I’m a SecUnit, not an engineer.

Our shuttle slot was six locks down, glowing emergency lighting showing me Mensah standing beside it holding a small energy weapon. Why the hell did she have that? Oh, because although a security barrier had dropped in the other gate at the end of this section, a small crowd of humans had been trapped here and stood back against the stationside bulkhead.

We needed to get out of here before somebody convinced PortSec to get those barriers up.

I shoved up and my knee joint started to give way. I staggered and Ratthi ran up to me. He hesitated, waving his hands. “Do you mind if we help—”

I gripped his shoulder to stay upright and tried not to fall on him. I was fairly sure the joint had been hit by shrapnel from drones destroyed in the air, as a direct hit would have taken my leg off. Gurathin ran to shoulder my other arm and we limp-ran awkwardly to the shuttle.

Mensah jerked her head to tell us to go in first while she covered our retreat. Arguing with her would be stupid, but it was hard to override that programming. We went through the hatch and then she backed in after us. She cycled the lock closed and yelled, “Pin-Lee, we’re clear!”

Thumps vibrated through the deck as the shuttle pushed away from the lock. I pulled away from Ratthi and Gurathin, who climbed out of the way so Mensah could step past us and up to the cockpit. It was a small ship-to-ship shuttle, with only one compartment with seating along the bulkheads, and a cubby for emergency supply storage and a restroom. I had ridden in this exact model of shuttle before, on contract.

My knee joint gave out and I collapsed on the deck. I’d tuned my pain sensors down, but maybe too much. I said, “Ratthi, I really need you to get this shrapnel out of my knee joint.”

Ratthi leaned over me. “Can it wait? There’s a MedSystem on the ship.”

I could already feel the company systems at the edge of my feed, recognizing me, wanting in. I accessed the shuttle’s cameras, fought a brief battle with ShuttleSecSys, and started deleting everything that had been recorded since the Preservation team boarded. Ratthi was being an optimist again. On the company ship, it wouldn’t be a MedSystem, it would be a cubicle. “It absolutely cannot wait,” I told him.

Ratthi dropped to the deck beside me and yelled for Gurathin to bring the shuttle’s emergency kit.

In the cockpit, Pin-Lee was monitoring the bot pilot while Mensah stood beside her. A warning from station Port Authority set off a comm alarm. “What is it?” Pin-Lee asked.

Mensah’s expression was hard with fury. “An ‘unnamed corporate resident’ has just launched a ship and it’s on an intercept course with us.”

Pin-Lee said something really filthy that wasn’t supposed to be in my language base. “Guess which corporate resident.”

They thought it was GrayCris, but I’m pretty sure it would be a Palisade ship, contracted by GrayCris. Ratthi got the scalpel and extractor out of the emergency kit. With Gurathin leaning over his shoulder, he opened the organic material just above my damaged knee joint to reach the shrapnel.

A Palisade ship could catch the shuttle and board it. The last thing I wanted was to ask the company gunship for help. The last thing I wanted was for GrayCris to catch us. The two last things were incompatible. It was time to stop fucking around. I accessed comm and secured a feed channel to the company gunship. 

I sent, System System.

I had three seconds to wonder if the company interface would still acknowledge me. I’d gotten to the bot pilot earlier, but that was a partial hack. This time I was going to the front door. Then I heard, Acknowledge.

I sent: Active, hazardous retrieval in progress, bonded clients, go go go go.

The reply was Received and the shuttle’s bot pilot reported that the gunship had just rotated toward us.

As Ratthi extracted the projectile from my knee joint, I watched the sensors.

The gunship accelerated. I couldn’t tell if it was communicating with the GrayCris intercept or not. Then Shuttle’s sensors picked up the energy signature that meant the gunship was powering up primary weapons. Oh yeah, they were communicating all right.

Ratthi tried to use wound sealant to close the hole in my organic tissue, but it wouldn’t take because of the proximity of my inorganic joint. I was going to leak for a while. “Are you okay?” he asked, watching me worriedly.

Gurathin sat on the bench, frowning at me.

“Not really,” I said.

Sensors showed that the Palisade ship had changed course and slowed. The view wavered as the gunship snatched us in passing and began to curve away from the station. The shuttle shivered as the hull closed around us. I grabbed the bench and started to climb to my feet.

Ratthi said, “Careful, careful. You don’t want to reopen—Oh, it’s still bleeding, sorry—”

Still frowning, Gurathin said, “They can’t take you away from us. Dr. Mensah will not allow it.”

The lock was cycling and Mensah stamped back through the shuttle, barefoot and mad. She handed her energy weapon to Gurathin, who shoved it into the shuttle’s emergency kit.

As the hatch opened, Mensah pushed forward in front of me.

Standing in the opening was a figure in a powered suit. It was an augmented human, not a SecUnit, but the gun was big enough.

Mensah planted her hands on either side of the hatch, making it clear they would have to come through her to get inside. “We are bonded clients, and this is my personal security consultant. Is there a problem?”

A crew member peered out from behind the suit and said, “Dr. Mensah, SecUnits are not allowed aboard armed transports, unless there are special circumstances. It’s … too dangerous.”

Mensah said, “These are special circumstances.” Her voice was icy.

Nobody moved. The ship’s secured feed activity went frantic for seven minutes that felt like thirty. (And the way I experience time, that’s a lot.) (Yes, I started some media in background.) The gunship’s bot pilot pinged me curiously. Active SecUnits are never carried on gunships because they’re right, it’s too dangerous; we’re shipped on unarmed transports as cargo. The bot pilot had communicated with SecUnits over the feed on missions, but it had never had one aboard before.

Then the comm activated and a voice said, “Dr. Mensah, this is the ship’s combat supervisor. I’ve been asked to secure a bond to guarantee safety aboard this ship.”

Ratthi objected, “What? We already have a bond.”

The comm clarified, “This bond is required when bringing an unsecured deadly weapon aboard an armed company transport.”

Yes, that’s me they’re talking about. It would have been more funny if I hadn’t been leaking onto the deck.

Pin-Lee’s voice was somewhere between furious and incredulous. “Are they serious? Right, never mind, that was a stupid question, of course they’re serious.” She turned as Gurathin handed her their bag. She muttered, “How much do these fuckers want now?”

She was right, they were fuckers. Not that I hadn’t known that before, but it was just harder to take now. I tapped my private feed connection to Mensah and said, I can take over this ship.

Mensah replied, No, there’s no need, we can pay them.

We shouldn’t have to. We don’t have to . The bot pilot was curious and friendly, but it was no ART, it couldn’t stop me. I could take over the ship’s SecSystem before this human with the temptingly large familiar projectile weapon could blink. I could get that weapon before that human could blink. I wanted to do it, and it bled through into the feed.

Mensah turned, gripped the collar of my jacket with both hands, and said, “No.”

Everyone got quiet. Ratthi and Gurathin, Pin-Lee still fishing in the bag for hard currency cards, the crew outside the hatch, the voice on the comm. I suddenly needed to see Mensah’s face and I dropped the shuttleSec camera views and looked down at her.

She looked mad and exhausted, which was exactly the way I felt. I sent, You have no idea what I am.

She tilted her head and looked more mad. I know exactly what you are. You’re afraid, you’re hurt, and you need to calm the fuck down so we can get through this situation alive.

I said, I am calm. You need to be calm, to take over a gunship.

Mensah’s eyes narrowed. Security consultants don’t get their clients into unnecessary pitched battles for control of their rescue ship . She added, Because that would be stupid.

She wasn’t afraid of me. And it hit me that I didn’t want that to change. She had just been through a traumatic experience, and I was making it worse. Something was overwhelming me, and it wasn’t the familiar wave of not-caring.

Fine, I sent. I sounded sulky, because I was sulky.

I hate emotions.

“Good,” she said aloud. “Pin-Lee, do we have the money for this idiotic unnecessary bond?”

“Yes.” Pin-Lee waved a handful of hard currency cards. “If that’s not enough, I have our account info, I can transmit an authorization—”

Mensah finished glaring at me and turned around. The crew who had just watched her face down a rogue SecUnit, in person and via the powered armor’s helmet cam, stared wide-eyed. She said, “Since we are bonded clients, may we come aboard while we settle our bill?”

There was a hesitation, then the comm said, “Please come aboard, Dr. Mensah.”

I told you the thing about SecUnits not being allowed to sit on human furniture while on or off duty. So the first thing I did when the crew led us through the lock and down the corridor to a passenger seating area was to sit down on the padded bench.

(I’m not sure it made any impression on the humans. Humans don’t notice these things. But it felt good to me.)

Gurathin sat on the bench against the opposite wall and Ratthi plopped down next to me. This was a big compartment a couple of levels below the flight deck, probably used for meetings with non-company personnel, since it was isolated from the rest of the ship’s structure and the upholstery was relatively new.

The ship’s security crew had stationed themselves in the wide corridor outside the compartment, though the one in powered armor had retreated out of immediate view. (The crew thought they had the SecSystem locked down so I couldn’t get into it. They were wrong.) One crew member was trying to convince Dr. Mensah to go to a cabin to rest, but Dr. Mensah was busy checking over the new bond agreement while Pin-Lee arranged payment.

Listening to the SecSystem’s audio, I heard a crew member in the corridor say, “I’ve never seen one out of armor. They really do look human.”

I made a gesture in that direction that I had only seen in the shows that were rated high on the obscenity scale. Gurathin saw me and made a choking noise. 

Then Mensah gave Pin-Lee her okay on the bond agreement, and walked over to glare down at me. In a low voice, she said, “I am so furious with you.”

Ratthi drew back nervously. (Me, Ratthi wasn’t afraid of, but when Dr. Mensah was mad it was better to be in another room.) He said, “Uh, do you want to speak in private—”

“You should sit down,” I told her. “You’ve been through a traumatic experience. Tell them you need the MedSystem’s Retrieved Client Trauma Evaluation protocol—”

“It’s right, you really should get a medical evaluation—” Gurathin began, Ratthi and Pin-Lee chiming in to agree.

“Never mind that.” Mensah had no intention of being distracted. “You stayed behind to get yourself killed.”

Okay, aside from the fact that that was actually my intention at the time, that was not my fault. “They wouldn’t have let me through. I told PortSec if they let you through to the shuttle, I’d stay behind.”

That stopped her. Her brow furrowed. “Is that why you stayed?”

I could have lied. I didn’t want to. “Mostly,” I said. I looked at her with my actual eyes again. “I wanted to win.”

Ratthi, Gurathin, and Pin-Lee all watched me. The company crew incompetently pretended not to try to eavesdrop. Dr. Mensah’s expression softened, just around the edges. Ratthi said, “Why did you come through, then, when Gurathin got the barrier open?”

“Because that last one was a Combat SecUnit and it was going to tear me apart. That’s not winning.” I wish I knew what winning was. And once I started telling the truth, it was hard to stop. “I don’t want to be here.”

Pin-Lee sat down beside Ratthi. “We won’t be here for long. We’re going to rendezvous with a Preservation ship after this wormhole jump and get off this flying vending machine.” She glared toward the crew. “It’s like everything I hate about the corporates wrapped up in one heavily armed package.”

You could say that about me, too. I asked Dr. Mensah, “Then what?”

“That’s what you and I need to talk about,” she said. She glanced at the company crew. “Though let’s wait until we’re not being recorded—”

I lost the rest because I caught an alert from the bot pilot to the gunship’s human captain. We were on approach to the wormhole but the hostile was still tracking us. The ship’s SecSystem had just deflected an attempt to establish a connection via comm to the ship’s internal feed.

“Hostile engaging,” I said. I stood up automatically, but there was nowhere to go. This could be really bad. I didn’t know anything about ship-to-ship combat, but from the alert levels … Palisade couldn’t deliver a code attack via our comm, could they? Outside in the corridor the crew had all gone still, heads tilted, listening to the captain’s feed.

“What?” Ratthi said.

“They’re firing on us?” Mensah said.

“No. It’s a— Incoming!” Too late. Comm had just engaged and was receiving. Above us on the flight deck the captain yelled for someone to manually shut down the feed and someone else was ripping open panels to get to the components. SecSystem snapped into defense mode and walled off life support and weapons. I yelled, “Disengage from the feed, now!” Ratthi and Pin-Lee fumbled to take their interfaces out of their ears, and I cut the connection to Mensah’s implant and threw a wall around Gurathin’s internal augment. Two augmented humans in the corridor fell to the deck, writhing, and I threw walls around them, too. SecSystem should do that, but it was busy fighting off the commands to open the airlocks and allow the ship to decompress.

On the flight deck someone said, “How—How could they—”

Someone replied, “Shitfuckers have our codes, they overrode comm protection—”

Palisade had obtained a set of company comm codes, and had tried the list on our comm until they found one that worked. (Like my list of drone control keys that I used to take over the security drones on Milu and in the TranRollinHyfa port.) Once the connection was made, they had delivered a code bundle to the ship’s feed. Not standard malware or killware, not something I had ever seen before. It was in the ship’s systems, trying to cause a catastrophic drive failure, trying to take down life support, jamming the bot pilot’s command system. SecSystem flung up walls but the hostile code was eating right through them. It was eating SecSystem.

SecSystem lost another wall and the main airlock started to cycle. I slipped into the ship’s control feed and caused a heat surge in all airlock hatches, fusing everything but the manual controls. I tried to cut all non-manual access to engineering but I was too late, the drive started to fail, our engines were cycling down. Sensors showed the Palisade ship on approach. On the flight deck the captain had given two orders to fire main weapons but the bot pilot no longer had access. Gravity ceased abruptly in a backbone tube, trapping the humans trying to get manual access to systems. The captain was trying to assemble the armed retrieval team to repel boarding, but half were augmented humans who were now incapacitated by the attack on their augments and the other half were fighting sealed doors to reach their defensive positions.

I flailed. I tried to help SecSystem but it was dissolving under my hands.

The bot pilot couldn’t speak in words like ART, but in my head I felt its terror. It sent Code: System System. Assistance. Endangered.

It was trying to ask me for help using the company codes, the way I’d asked for help for my clients.

Fuck this. GrayCris is not going to win.

I slipped all the way into the ship, into the pilot bot’s hardware. I’d seen ART do it.

(Yes, ART’s processing capacity is much larger than mine. I’ll address that issue when it comes up, which is real soon now.)

I suddenly had a different body, hard vacuum on a metal skin, I saw the approaching ship with my eyes, not just sensors. It had dispatched a boarding shuttle that was coming in fast, heading toward the gunship’s main docking lock. I pulled back in; there was no time for sightseeing. The bot pilot wanted to know what we should do. It was a good question.

Inhabiting the same hardware like this, the bot pilot and I could communicate almost instantaneously. I pulled SecSystem’s analysis of the attacker so we could both examine it. It wasn’t just a code sequence like malware or killware. It was a conscious bot, moving through the feed like I did, like ART, but with no physical struc ture to go back to; that was why it was so fast. It was like a disembodied combat bot.

The bot pilot asked if the Attacker was a construct created from human neural tissue, rather than a bot, and indicated points in the analysis that would confirm that theory.

I told it that was worse, and better. A disembodied construct would be more vicious, but it would also be easier to trick.

I had an idea I outlined for the bot pilot. If we could trap the Attacker’s code bundle in a contained area and destroy it, we could regain control of the affected systems. But to get the Attacker to go into a contained area, we needed bait. We needed to know what the Attacker wanted/had been sent to do.

Bot pilot said that it wanted to destroy the ship and crew.

I said there had to be a reason. There was no profit for GrayCris in killing us, and a lot of risk in antagonizing the bond company by destroying a ship this expensive. 

I reactivated my body, standing rigid in the passenger seating area. Ratthi was out in the corridor, doing rescue breathing on an augmented human crew member who had collapsed due to the attack on her augments. Gurathin was out there, too, both hands in a panel access, holding a corridor hatch open so crew could bypass the backbone and get to the drive. Pin-Lee and Mensah both sat on the floor with two crew members. All four had portable manual interfaces open and were frantically entering code, shoring up SecSystem’s walls. They weren’t fast enough, but what was left of SecSystem probably appreciated the thought.

I said, “Dr. Mensah, why do you think GrayCris is doing this? What do they want?”

Everybody flinched. “What is it doing?” a crew member demanded. “It could have been taken over by the—”

“Shut up,” Dr. Mensah snapped at the crew member. To me, she said, “We think it’s Milu. They must think you have the data you took from Milu with you.”

“It’s got to be that,” Pin-Lee added, not looking up from her display surface. “They could have killed us as soon as we arrived on TranRollinHyfa, but they wanted the money. It’s only been since they realized you were here that things got violent.”

You know, I bet that’s it. And I bet it had something to do with the memory clip I took from Wilken and Gerth. CrayGris must know it existed, must believe I had it. They were too late, since it was in the Preservation system by now, but I doubt they were going to believe that. But it did give me something to work with. “I need someone to trigger a manual disengage of the shuttle we arrived in.”

Mensah dropped her interface and shoved to her feet. “We’ll do it. Pin-Lee—”

“Coming!”

“Thank you for your assistance,” my buffer said, as I shut down again and went back to the bot pilot.

Back in accelerated time, I explained to the bot pilot what I wanted to try. It was fighting for control of its weapon systems, trying to follow the captain’s order to fire. It showed me an intel fragment from the boarding shuttle: manifest suggested a Combat SecUnit was aboard, along with an augmented human boarding team.

Yeah, we couldn’t let that shuttle lock on.

I hadn’t made a copy of the memory clip, but I still had all that data I had recorded on the trip to Milu, all those cycles of Wilken and Gerth talking about not much of anything. It had been analyzed and compressed, but it might resemble the parameters of what Attacker was searching for long enough to make this work.

I couldn’t risk cameras or feed, so I walked my body out of the passenger area and into the shuttle access corridor. I’d fused that hatch, too, but Mensah and Pin-Lee had the panel open for the emergency disengage. “Wait for my signal,” I said.

I told bot pilot we were going to have to make this good. It agreed, and we worked out what we were going to do.

Then bot pilot disengaged SecSystem.

I knew we had to do it but it was terrifying to be so vulnerable. I could feel Attacker bearing down on bot pilot, on me. I told bot pilot we needed to protect this important information so the company could retrieve it later and that I would hide it in the shuttle. Bot pilot ripped the confused ShuttleBotPilot out of its memory core and I dumped the data bundle into its place.

And Attacker transferred itself into the shuttle’s system.

Three things happened at once: (1) ShuttleSecSystem walled the shuttle’s comm system. (2) Bot pilot deleted its own comm system codes and I overloaded and fused its hardware. (3) My body told Dr. Mensah and Pin-Lee, “Now.”

Pin-Lee’s hands moved in the panel and Dr. Mensah worked the controls. The shuttle disengaged.

The gunship was moving slowly at that point, so the shuttle didn’t drop very far away, but with our comms fried it might as well have been on the other side of the wormhole. Attacker was gone, trapped in the shuttle.

Hah, I thought. Take that, you fucker .

Ship’s feed and system codes were trashed, but bot pilot was already reasserting control. SecSystem did the system equivalent of staggering drunkenly to its feet. Someone on the flight deck said, “Oh, mothergods, we’re clear!”

Bot pilot regained control of its weapon system and queried the captain. The captain said, “Confirm, fire.”

I stayed long enough to enjoy the boarding shuttle disappearing in one explosive burst, and the multiple impacts breaching the Palisade ship’s hull, then pulled my scattered code together and dropped back into my body. It felt weird.

Mensah and Pin-Lee still stood in the corridor, watching me worriedly. “We’re clear,” I told them.

Pin-Lee made an excited whooping noise and Mensah grabbed her and swung her around.

I felt weird. Very weird. Very bad.

Performance reliability at 45 percent and dropping. Catastrophic failure—

I felt my body crumple, but I didn’t feel myself hit the deck.

My memory was in fragments. I didn’t feel great about it, but it wasn’t the disaster it would have been for a full bot. My human neural tissue, normally the weak link in my whole data storage system, couldn’t be wiped. I had to rely on it to put the fragments back in order and unfortunately its access speed was terrible.

It was taking fucking forever.

I wandered through random images, bursts of pain, landscapes, corridors, walls. Wow, that was a lot of walls.

(Unidentified voices on audio: “Any change?”

“Not yet.” A hesitation. “Do you think we should have let them put it in the cubicle? If it can’t—”

“No. No, absolutely not. They’ve got to want to know how it beat its governor module. If they had the opportunity … We can’t trust them.”)

The worst part was that I couldn’t remember (hah) how long I had been in this state. What little diagnostic info I had suggested a catastrophic failure of some sort.

Maybe that was obvious without the diagnostic data.

A complex series of neural connections, all positive, led me to a large intact section of protected storage … What the hell was this? The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon ? I started to review it.

And boom, hundreds of thousands of connections blossomed. I had control over my processes again and initiated a diagnostic and data repair sequence. Memories started to sort and order at a higher rate.

(Voice on audio: “Good news! Diagnostics are showing greatly accelerated activity. It’s putting itself back together.”)

(Partial identification: client?)

A curved ceiling instead of a wall. That was different. I was lying on a padded surface. I had enough access to memory to know that was unusual, and that unusual usually meant bad. More fragments resolved into coherency, just not in the right order. Transports, Ship, ART. Right, not so unusual then. I was wearing human clothes and not a suit skin and armor, so that matched. Access to another set of connections let me identify the objects overhead as equipment associated with MedSystems. ART? I tried to ping. No, that memory was out of order. I’d taken Tapan back to her friends and left ART.

(Ratthi asked me, “How do you feel?”

The only tag I can access on Ratthi is a partial that says my human friend. That’s strange and unlikely, but the pre-catastrophic-failure version of me seemed sure about it, and I don’t have anything else to go on. “Fine.” 

Possibly it’s obvious that I’m not fine. Ratthi said, “Do you know where you are?”

I didn’t have an answer. My buffer said, “Please wait while I search for that information.”

“Okay,” Ratthi said. “Okay.”)

I was in a MedSystem, with the kind of equipment meant for humans or augmented humans recovering from serious medical procedures. There were two hatches in the cabin, one open and one closed. It took me a minute—and I mean a full minute, my access speed was terrible—to recognize the symbol on the closed door as an archaic sign for a restroom. Oh, well, great, a whole minute for something completely unhelpful.

So this was a place you put humans, not bots or SecUnits. Did they think I was a human? That was just stressful, I didn’t want to pretend to be human right now. But I was missing my jacket and my boots. I don’t have any organic parts on my feet and they don’t look like medical augments for an injured human. And, oh right, I was in a MedSystem, which would have immediately diagnosed that I had a terminal case of being a SecUnit.

(“I don’t want to be a pet robot.”

“I don’t think anyone wants that.”

That was Gurathin. I don’t like him. “I don’t like you.”

“I know.”

He sounded like he thought it was funny. “That is not funny.”

“I’m going to mark your cognition level at fifty-five percent.”

“Fuck you.”

“Let’s make that sixty percent.”)

A memory popped up: the company gunship.

A flash of terror hit, so intense it paralyzed me.

But these walls were scuffed, scratched metal, marked with the ghosts of multiple installations. Conclusion: this was not the company gunship.

The one good thing about having emotions was that it accelerated the repair process for my memory storage. (The bad thing about having emotions is, you know, OH SHIT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ME.) I frantically checked my governor module. But my hack was still in place. Results from the ongoing diagnostic showed that my data port hadn’t been repaired, either. The burst of fear had used up all my oxygen and I had to take a breath. I found the code structures for my walls and started reassembling.

(“I don’t want to be human.”

Dr. Mensah said, “That’s not an attitude a lot of humans are going to understand. We tend to think that because a bot or a construct looks human, its ultimate goal would be to become human.”

“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”)

When I fell on the floor, I discovered I’d been concentrating so hard on rebuilding my memory I’d prioritized it over my operational code. I started another rebuild process, which just slowed everything down. But the organic parts in my head remembered how to stand and walk and it would go faster if I made the rest of me re-learn it.

In attempting to walk, I’d gathered more current data: the medical setup had been retrofitted into an older structure. Old bolts and fittings still marked places on the cabin walls where previous equipment configurations had been changed or removed. Big cables had been run along the walls, then clamped off as no longer necessary. Faded paint and letters were scratched into the bulkhead, phrases, names. The manual control panel for the hatch was so old-fashioned I thought it was a small art installation.

There was a big port, which was strange, since in a wormhole there’s nothing to look at.

Except we weren’t in a wormhole, this was space, and we were on approach to a station. On visual there was nothing but spots of light, but the flight deck was sending sensor data through the comm, which allowed the room’s display surface to give us a close-up view of the station. (Yes, it was complicated and awkward, but that’s what you get when you have a shitty feedless ship.)

Strangely, a large part of the station was designed to look like a giant old-fashioned ship, with … Oh wait, that was a giant old-fashioned ship, with a more conventional circular transit ring built out from the hold area. It was old and ugly but it was no Milu; there were lots of transports and smaller ships in dock. I cautiously extended my reach past my walls and picked up the edge of a station feed.

Dr. Mensah said, “Do you know where you are now?”

Home to her meant a planet. I knew that because I’d shipped memory clips to her family there. Important memory clips. Memory clips that had almost gotten us killed. I said, “I don’t like planets. There’s dust and weather, and something always wants to eat the humans. And planets are much harder to escape from.”

Behind her, Gurathin said, “I think that’s a yes.”

The ship didn’t have any cameras so I couldn’t see anybody. No, wait, I could use my eyes.

“We’re coming up on Preservation Transit Station,” Mensah said. “Do you know what happened?”

“I had a catastrophic failure. I think that’s obvious.”

She nodded. “You extended yourself too far when you were fighting off the code attack on the company ship. Do you remember?”

I think I did, but I didn’t want to talk about it. “Why is this ship so old and shitty?”

Ratthi objected, “Hey, it may be old, but it’s not shitty. It came to Preservation packed into the hold of that much bigger ship, the one that’s become the station, with our grandparents. Well, not Gurathin’s grandparents, he came later.”

“Your grandparents were packed in the hold.” I was skeptical. I’d been packed in a lot of holds and I hadn’t seen any humans in there. Not that I could see inside the other transport boxes, but … You know what I mean.

Mensah had a smile in her voice. I remembered what that sounded like. “They were in suspension boxes, because the trip took almost two hundred years. They were refugees from a failed colony world, and it was the only way to escape. When they arrived in the Preservation system, they were able to make an alliance with two other systems settled earlier by similar refugee ships. When ships from the Corporation Rim discovered us, they refused their help, which kept us independent.”

I found a pocket of archived data on Preservation. Right, my status there was better than equipment or deadly weapon, but I would still have to have an owner. And be a happy bot servant, or something like that. Yeah, that was going to go well.

Possibly I said that out loud, or had said that out loud at some point, because Dr. Mensah said, “No one else on this ship knows you’re a SecUnit. They think that you’re a person with a large number of augments, who was injured while helping us, and that you’re being brought to Preservation as a refugee.”

I actually turned around and looked at her. She was standing next to me, Gurathin was sitting in a chair with a portable display surface bubble, Ratthi was on the bench, and Pin-Lee was leaning on the wall next to the hatch. (And this ship is shitty. It smells like human socks.)

“That last part is true, technically,” Pin-Lee said. “You fit the legal definition of a refugee.”

“It’s very dramatic,” Ratthi added. “The crew think you’re a special security agent who betrayed the company to save us.”

It was very dramatic, like something out of a historical adventure serial. Also correct in every aspect except for all the facts, like something out of a historical adventure serial. 

Mensah said, “We have more options now that you’ve changed your appearance, and have been successful at…” She was hesitating over the phrase pretending to be human. I remembered at least three conversations about that. “Let’s say, not being noticed. I want to keep those options open until you’re completely well and you can tell me what you want to do.” She was watching me carefully. “On Port FreeCommerce, I thought you would need a great deal of assistance before you could fit into human society. I was wrong about that and I apologize.”

I focused on her. “I don’t want to go to the planet.”

She nodded. “That’s fine. You can stay on the transit station.”

I was stuck, so I might as well make the best of it. “In a hotel?”

“If you like.”

“With a big display surface.”

She smiled. “That can probably be arranged.”

New memories kept popping up and sliding into place and my connections to all my stored media were coming back, which was distracting because I kept tuning out the outside world to watch them. But they also sparked neural connections that accelerated my process rebuild. When we docked at the Preservation transit ring, Mensah and Pin-Lee left the ship first to distract the humans waiting for us, which included a lot of outsystem journalists. When a crew member signaled it was clear, Ratthi and Gurathin walked me out through the embarkation zone.

They took me to a hotel attached to the station’s admin center, to one of the suites reserved for diplomatic guests. It was nice, even though its security monitoring was completely inadequate. I got a set of rooms to myself, though they were connected to the suites where the others were staying. It was a little like a mini-hotel inside a big hotel.

I didn’t like it.

I went back into the room with a bed and a display surface and locked the door. An hour later, Ratthi tapped my feed and sent, We set up a little network. I hope it helps.

I cautiously initiated a search. They had put cameras in all the suite lounges and connecting hallways, so I could see everything.

I had a complex emotional reaction. A whole new burst of neural connections blossomed. Oh right, I often have complex emotional reactions which I can’t easily interpret.

I made adjustments to the code to make sure no one could hack the new network from outside. Then I unlocked my door.

Mensah had quarters in another part of the station, used for when she was here on government business, and a large portion of her family had come up to see her and be excited about the fact that she wasn’t dead. Pin-Lee, Ratthi, and Gurathin had to stay on the station for now because there were going to be a lot of meetings in the government offices in the admin center next door. Meet ings about GrayCris and the bond company and what happened with Palisade.

Twelve hours after we arrived, Arada and Overse came to see everyone. By that point I was able to access my archive on them and remember: (1) they were clients (2) they were a couple (3) they liked each other and (4) they liked me. I watched them with my local camera network for twenty-three minutes and then came out of my room to let them talk to me. The humans seemed happy about that.

Arada didn’t hug me, though she bounced up and down and waved her arms. Thirteen hours later, after she had talked with the others, she said to me, “In a few months, we’re going on a small assessment survey. It’s an independent site outside the Corporation Rim, so there wouldn’t be any bond company or … We wouldn’t have to worry about that. We’d like you to come along to keep us from getting killed. I don’t know what you’d like in exchange—”

“It likes hard currency cards,” Gurathin said. I looked at him. He said, “I’ll take the obscene gesture as given.”

“You’ll have to wait to discuss it,” Pin-Lee told them. “It can’t enter into any contractual agreements until it completes its memory rebuild.”

“Why?” I asked her. “Because my owner says so?”

“No, asshole,” Pin-Lee said. “Because I’m your legal counsel.”

After that conversation, after the others had gone to sleep, Pin-Lee came back to my room and picked up my bag. (Once I remembered it existed, I’d checked it and found Wilken and Gerth’s ID markers and the currency cards I hadn’t used yet were still there.) Pin-Lee said, “This is technically illegal, so don’t tell anybody,” and put three new ID markers and currency cards into my bag. She said, “This is just some insurance if anything goes sideways. Gurathin made the IDs, and these are cards Ratthi and I got for the trip to TranRollinHyfa, but didn’t use. Preservation doesn’t have an internal currency economy and these are drawn from the citizens’ travel fund.”

“Why?” I said.

“Because I want you to know we’re serious, that you’re not some kind of prisoner or pet or whatever it is you think.” And then she stomped out.

When humans I didn’t know came to visit, I hid back in my room. I spent a lot of time there anyway, even when not hiding, because the rebuild process was taking up a lot of my resources. Just lying on the bed with local media playing on the display surface was all I could do for three to four hour periods.

Twenty-nine hours after arrival, Ratthi came to get me because a newsburst was on the big display surface in the suite’s main lounge area and everyone was watching it. Mensah was there, too. The newsburst had a lot of interviews with various humans, but basically it said that the bond company was still mad about the attack on the gunship and had declared war on GrayCris. (Even in my current state, I knew that was not going to turn out well for GrayCris.) Also, a lot of other corporations and political entities were now involved, because of all the information about GrayCris’ past history of illegal collection of strange synthetics. The newsburst referred to the data I’d brought from Milu and played sections of Wilken and Gerth’s blackmail memory clip, which included video of GrayCris agents and executives in possession of illegal alien remnants. (I watched a little media in background during that part, since I’d already seen the whole clip.)

“We’re out of it now,” Gurathin said, and made a throwing gesture at the display surface. “They can tear each other apart.”

“We’re never out of it while we have to interact with the corporates,” Mensah said. “But this is a relief.”

Arada said, “What do you think, SecUnit?”

The rebuild process was increasing in speed again, and I suddenly didn’t have any space left for talking to humans. I got up and went back to my room.

Rebuild Process Complete at Cognition Level 100 percent

At thirty-seven hours since arrival, I sat up. I said, aloud, “That was stupid.” Everything was clear, sharp. Note to self, never, ever jump into a gunship with a bot pilot and fight off a construct Attacker code again. You almost deleted yourself, Murderbot.

I climbed off the bed and did a brief sweep of the suite via my cameras. Most of the humans had gone to a dinner event somewhere. Overse and Arada were asleep in Pin-Lee’s room, and Gurathin was sitting up in his room reading academic journals in the feed.

I got my bag, found my jacket and boots and put them on, and slipped out of the suite. 

The station’s security was more like Milu: concentrated in areas where something might actually go wrong, and not in occupation spaces or the station mall. They had weapon scanners concentrated around the docks, but hardly any drones, and most of those were being used for small goods deliveries. A lot of effort had gone into the mall area, with rounded structures made to look like they were built out of wood, and a lot of real plants instead of holos, mosaic tiles set into the deck depicting flora and fauna from the planets in the system, with attached tags in the feed providing information about each one. As a distraction for the humans walking around me, they worked great. Everyone was looking down for the tiles or reading the feed, and not noticing stray wandering SecUnits.

None of the local newsfeeds that Ratthi and Pin-Lee and the others watched had said that I was here, and while the newsbursts carried in from the Corporation Rim said Dr. Mensah’s SecUnit had been involved in the escape from TranRollinHyfa, I’d done such a good job cutting myself out of security video, all they had was the old pre-configuration change image from Port FreeCommerce. That was one big thing I didn’t have to worry about.

The other thing that was different about this station mall was that feed advertising was restricted by a distance limit, so the displays were mostly inside the stores. Which were weird. From what I could see in the feed, there were two financial systems, one using hard currency for travelers, and a barter-based system for local citizens.

Fortunately the booking kiosks took hard currency cards.

I’d checked the transit schedules and had time to kill, so I went to a section of the station mall that was listed as a “Welcome Center.” I had never seen anything like it in a port before, but then, I’d never looked, so maybe I’d just missed it. It had kiosks and information displays about all the planets and stations in the Preservation Alliance. A dome overhead duplicated sky views from various Preservation planets, and actual humans and augmented humans stood around to answer questions for humans who wanted to live here. Trying to avoid them, I walked into what I thought was a shop that turned out to be a theater.

I’d never seen a theater in real life before, just on shows in the entertainment media. The story was shown in holo, in the middle of the room, with big comfortable seats all around it, not too close to each other. I know it was just a giant display surface, but still. This one had a three-hour holo show about how the first colonists had arrived. Basically the long version of what Ratthi and Mensah had told me, about the big ship fleeing the doomed colony. It was a good story, even if the tone was a little dry.

After it was over, I went back to the embarkation zone and checked the activity around the transports I’d flagged. Still no increased security presence.

I bought passage with one of Pin-Lee’s cards and found a transient waiting area with actual couches and chairs where I could pretend to sleep while watching media and monitoring the station security feed. Still nothing.

My transport called for boarding, and I didn’t get on.

I checked the station directory and found Mensah had an office in the government admin block in the same section as the Port Authority. Her private quarters was listed, too. (Which is just a bad idea. I know Preservation thinks of itself as some kind of human non-corporate paradise, but let’s be real.) I didn’t want to go to her home anyway, since her family would be there, so I went to the office.

There was some security monitoring to get past, and three augmented humans who were way too easily distracted by fake feed alerts for routine malfunctions. It was a nice office, with a balcony overlooking the admin plaza area and some big display surfaces. I didn’t touch anything except the couch, which I laid down on and watched episodes for eight hours.

I had the station feed backburnered, and there were still no security alerts, no unusual activity around the passenger or bot-piloted transports.

Then I picked up Mensah arriving in the outer foyer with two humans and a small juvenile human, who looked like a miniature version of Mensah. I stood up and waited.

They walked in and stopped abruptly.

I said, “It’s me.”

“Yes, I see that.” Mensah pressed her lips together, hiding her expression, but she didn’t look mad. She glanced back at the other humans, then told me, “Just a moment.”

While she spoke to them, I stepped out onto the balcony. There was an air barrier protecting it from the plaza two levels below, which was better than nothing, I guess. The plaza had a big mosaic tile pattern with real plants in elaborate abstract sculptures around it. Humans and bots wandered across it on the way to the other port offices. Faint steps on audio told me the small human had followed me out. She stepped up to the railing, frowning curiously at me. She said, “Hello.”

“Hello,” I said. “I’m your mother’s pet security consultant.”

She nodded. “I know. She said if I asked you your name, you probably wouldn’t tell me.”

“She’s right.”

We stared at each other for ten seconds, then she decided I was serious. She added, “She also said you saved her from a bunch of corporate goons.”

“She didn’t say ‘goons. ’” It was an archaic word. I knew it without having to look it up because the new series of Adventures in the Free Systems, which was made on one of the other worlds in the Preservation Alliance, had dropped locally twenty hours ago and it had used the word “goons.” I was 93 percent certain that was where Mensah’s small human had picked it up, too.

“You know what I mean.” She folded her arms. She had clearly expected to get more information out of me and was disappointed this was apparently not going to happen. “You saved her, right?”

“Yeah. Want to see?”

She lifted her brows, surprised. “Sure.”

I’d already pulled my video of the last part of our run through the TRH embarkation zone, the fight with the SecUnits and the Combat SecUnit, and our escape in the shuttle. I did a rapid edit to cut out some of the bloodier close-ups, and then sent it to her feed.

Her gaze went inward, then a little glassy as she reviewed it. In the tone of a young human who was impressed but trying not to show it, she said, “Wow.”

“Your mother saved me, too. She shot a SecUnit with a sonic mining drill.”

She finished the vid and frowned at me again. “So, you’re a SecUnit.” She made a half-shrug gesture I didn’t understand. “Is that … weird?”

It was a complicated question with a simple answer. “Yes.”

Mensah came out onto the balcony and pointed firmly toward the seating area back inside the office. Small human waved goodbye and went to sit down. Mensah leaned against the railing next to me and said, “I was afraid you’d left.”

She kept her gaze on the plaza, so I could look at the side of her face. “I thought about it.”

She was quiet for twenty seconds, watching the movement in the plaza below. “Have you thought much about what you want to do?”

“Watch media.”

She did the lifted eyebrow look which I had on file as meaning: I know you’re trying to be funny but you’re not funny. It was most often aimed at Ratthi and Gurathin. “I think if that was all you wanted to do, you’d be off somewhere doing it, and you’d never have gone to Milu.” 

“I watched a lot of media on the way to Milu.” It wasn’t exactly a counterargument, but I thought it was important data.

“Gurathin showed me the video you shared with him.” She meant the video of the transport with Ayres and the others. “You were helping those people.”

“I couldn’t help them. They had a contract labor agreement.”

I saw from her reaction that she knew exactly what that meant. “It was too late for you to help them, then.” She started to turn toward me, then looked out over the plaza again. “But you wanted to.”

“I’m programmed to help humans.”

Eyebrow lift again. “You’re not programmed to watch media.”

She had a point.

She continued, “The reason I ask, is that you’ve received a job offer from GoodNightLander Independent.”

Okay, now that was a surprise. “They want to buy me. I thought I was illegal in the territories they operate in.”

“It’s illegal to own a SecUnit,” Mensah corrected. “They want to hire someone who may or may not be called Rin, who they suspect is based somewhere in the Preservation Alliance, whose citizenship status will be considered immaterial.” She smiled. “I think that’s how they put it.”

I still couldn’t believe this. “They want to hire a SecUnit.”

“They want to hire the person who saved their assessment team from combat bots and contract killers, and they don’t care what that person is.” She glanced at me again. “Also, I’ve been talking to Dr. Bharadwaj and she wants to ask you to consider making your story public. Not to the newsfeed, but as part of a documentary account. There’s been a small movement for a while in the Preservation Alliance to press for full citizenship for constructs and high-level bots. She thinks a full account of your situation, in your own words, could be a great contribution. Even if all you did was agree to release the message you sent to me before you left Port FreeCommerce, as part of a public account of the GrayCris incident, it would help. She’d like to discuss it with you, if you feel it’s something you could consider.”

Okay, maybe I should have been appalled. It was a terrifying idea. It was a terrifyingly attractive idea. I said, “A documentary on the entertainment feed?”

Mensah nodded. “Again, there’s no rush about any of this. I just want you to know you already have options here, and I expect you’ll have more offers for your services or advice as a security consultant. And that you have friends here you can discuss things with, whatever you decide to do, or wherever you decide to go.”

I had options, and I didn’t have to decide right away. Which was good, because I still didn’t know what I wanted.

But maybe I had a place to be while I figured it out.

I’ve had clients who thought they needed an absurd level of security. (And I’m talking absurd even by my standards, and my code was developed by a bond company known for intense xenophobic paranoia, tempered only by desperate greed.) I’ve also had clients who thought they didn’t need any security at all, right up until something ate them. (That’s mostly a metaphor. My uneaten client stat is high.)

Dr. Arada, who is what her marital partner Overse calls a “terminal optimist,” was somewhere in the comfortable middle zone. Dr. Thiago was firmly in the “Let’s investigate the dark cave without that pesky SecUnit” group. Which was why Arada was pressed against the wall next to the hatch to the open observation deck with her palms sweating on the stock of a projectile weapon and Thiago was standing out on said observation deck, trying to reason with a potential target. (That’s “potential” per the earlier conversation where Dr. Arada said Oh SecUnit, I wish you wouldn’t call people “targets” and Thiago had given me the look that usually means It just wants an excuse to kill someone.)

But then, that was before the Potential Targets started to brandish their own large projectile-weapon collection.

Anyway, those are the kind of things I think about while I’m swimming under a raider vessel that’s attempting to board our sea research facility.

I swam out from under the stern, careful to avoid the propulsion device. I broke the surface quietly, stretched and caught the railing, and pulled myself up. The daylight was bright, the air clear, and I felt exposed. (Why couldn’t the stupid raiders attack at night?) I had drones in the air, giving me camera views of both decks of this stupid boat, so I knew this part of the stern was empty.

The superstructure above me was triangular, angled back in a way to make it faster or something, I don’t know, I’m a murderbot, I don’t give a crap about boats. The upper deck wrapped around the bow where the forward weapon emplacement was. It gave the stupid boat a lot of blindspots, which were someone else’s security nightmare. It was more sophisticated than the other boats we’d seen on this survey, with better tech.

Of course that just made it vulnerable.

I was also monitoring our outer perimeter and the scattered islands surrounding us, in case this was a distraction and there was a second boarding attempt planned. And of course I had a camera on the unfolding shitshow on the observation deck.

Thiago stood out there nearly four meters from the hatchway, not even wearing his protective gear, very much like a human who didn’t trust his SecUnit’s situation assessment. The apparent leader of the Potential Targets stood at the edge of the deck, barely three meters away, casually pointing a projectile weapon at Thiago. I was more worried about the six other Potential Targets scattered around on the stupid boat’s bow deck, and the nozzle of the weapon mounted above the bow deck currently trained on the upper level of our facility.

Some of the Potential Targets weren’t wearing helmets. There’s a thing you can do with these small intel drones (if your client orders you to, or if you don’t have a working governor module), when the hostiles are dumb enough to get aggressive without adequate body armor. You can accelerate a drone and send it straight at the hostile’s face. Even if you don’t hit an eye or ear and go straight through to the brain, you can make a crater in the skull. Doing this would solve the problem and get me back to new episodes of Lineages of the Sun much more quickly, but I knew Arada would make a sad face at me and Thiago would be pissed off. I would probably have to do it anyway. Unfortunately, Potential Target Leader was wearing a helmet.

(Thiago is a marital partner of Dr. Mensah’s brother, which is why I gave a crap about his opinion.)

Also, I had no intel yet on how many hostiles were inside the boat where the controls to the large weapon were. Prematurely eliminating the visible targets (excuse me, potential targets) on deck might just tip us out of incipient shitshow into full-on shitshow.

There was sort of a chance that Thiago might actually talk our way out of this. He was great at talking to other humans. But I had a drone waiting just inside the hatchway with Arada. (Overse would be upset if I let her marital partner get killed, and I liked Arada.)

Still managing to sound calm despite everything, Thiago said, “There’s no need for any of this. We’re researchers, we’re not doing anything to hurt anyone here.”

Potential Target Leader said something that our FacilitySystem translated through our feed as, “I showed you I’m serious. We’ll take what we want, then leave you in peace. Tell the others to come out.”

“We’ll give you supplies, but not people,” Thiago said.

“If you have nice supplies, I’ll leave the people.”

“You didn’t have to shoot anyone.” Heat crept into Thiago’s voice. “If you needed supplies, we would have given them to you.”

Don’t worry, the “anyone” who got shot was me.

(Thiago, while violating the security protocol everyone agreed to IN ADVANCE, had walked out to the observation deck to greet the strangers on their stupid boat. I followed and pulled him back from the edge, and so Potential Target Leader shot me instead of him. Got me right in the shoulder. I managed to fall off the observation deck and miss the water intake. Yes, I was pissed off.

“SecUnit, SecUnit, are you there—” Overse, in the facility’s command center, had shouted at me over the comm interface.

Yes, I’m fine, I’d sent her over the feed. It’s a good thing I don’t bleed like a human because hostile marine fauna was about all this situation needed. I’ve got everything under fucking control, okay.

“No, it says it’s fine,” I heard her relaying to the others on our comm. “Well, yes, it’s furious.”)

I swung over the railing and dropped to the deck. I’d tuned my pain sensors down but I could feel the projectile wedged in next to my support framework and it was annoying. Staying low, I crawled down the steps into the first cabin structure. The human inside was monitoring a primitive scanner system. (I’d jammed it even before I got shot, feeding it artistic static and random reports of anomalous energy signatures to keep it busy.) I choked her until she was unconscious and then broke her arm to give her something else to worry about if she revived too soon. I didn’t take her projectile weapon but I did pause to break a couple of its key components.

The room was stuffed with bags and containers and other human crap. There were neat storage racks but everything was jumbled on the deck. We had seen eleven groups of strange humans in water boats from a distance, and had been contacted by two of them. Both had been what Thiago called “unusually divergent” and some of the others had called deeply weird. Both groups had taken the same elaborate precautions to show they were approaching in a non-hostile manner and had not displayed any weapons. Both groups had wanted to trade supplies with us. (Arada and the others had wanted to just give them what they needed, but Thiago had asked them to trade their stories of why they were here on this planet.)

So okay, maybe Thiago had reason to suppose this group would also be non-hostile. But the earlier groups had given me a chance to develop a profile of local non-hostile approaches/interactions and this group hadn’t fit.

Nobody fucking listens to me. 

Potential Target Leader and their friends aboard Stupid Boat were also dressed better than the other humans we’d encountered, in clothing that looked newer if not cleaner. There was no planetary feed (stupid planet) but Stupid Boat had its own rudimentary feed that was heavy with games and pornography but light on anything that might be helpful for a security assessment, like who these people were and what they wanted. Even the individual humans’ feed signatures only contained info about sexual availability and gender presentation, which I didn’t give a damn about.

I slipped through into a grimy metal corridor, then a human stepped out of the next doorway. I disarmed them and slammed their head into the floor.

The door to the next compartment was closed, but one of my drones had landed on the roof earlier, flattened itself to a window, and got me some good scan and vid intel. That was kind of important, because this was the compartment with the control station for the large boat-busting projectile weapon that was currently pointed at our facility.

According to the drone’s video, one small human sat in the weapon station, their attention on a primitive camera-based targeting screen. Three large humans, all armed, sat around casually on battered station chairs, though the other stations had missing or badly jury-rigged or outdated equipment. They were chatting, watching Thiago and Potential Target Leader on the screen, la la la, just another day at work.

The compartment was a bulbous structure set to the right of the bow, and reinforced with metal to protect and support the large weapon. The six hostiles near the bow casually pointing projectile weapons at the facility’s observation deck were too far away to hear as long as I didn’t overdo it. So I snapped the lock and didn’t slam the door as I went through.

I hit Target One at the weapon station with an energy pulse from my left arm, throat punch to Target Two as the others came to their feet, pivot and smash kneecap of Target Three, slap Target Four’s weapon aside and break collarbone. I’d already had FacilitySys prepare a translation for me, the only sentence I figured I’d need. I said, “Make a noise, and everybody dies.”

Target One slumped unconscious over the weapon control station, wound steaming in the damp air. The other three stayed on the deck, whimpering and gurgling.

One of the hostiles outside had glanced around, but didn’t change position. Thiago, who was unexpectedly good at stalling, had avoided the question of whether the other researchers were going to come out on the observation deck so Potential Target Leader could decide if he wanted to abduct them or not. Thiago was now listing all our supplies and pretending to stumble over FacilitySys’s translation advice. (I knew he was pretending; he was a language expert among other things.) My drone view showed me that Potential Target Leader enjoyed watching Thiago sweat, and that maybe Thiago had noticed and was playing it up a little. He was pretty smart.

Okay, okay, I admit that it was a little upsetting that Thiago didn’t trust me.

(He and Mensah had had a conversation about me, back on Preservation Station when Arada was planning this survey. Transcript:

Thiago: “I know I’m in the minority here, but I have serious reservations.”

Mensah: “Arada is in charge of this survey, and she wants SecUnit. And frankly, if it isn’t the one providing security, I’ll withdraw my permission for Amena to go.”

(Amena is one of Mensah’s children and yes, she is on our facility right now. No pressure!)

Thiago: “You trust it that much?”

Mensah: “With my life, literally. I know what it will do to protect her, and you, and the rest of the team. Of course, it has its faults. In fact, it’s probably listening to us right now. Are you listening, SecUnit?”

Me, on the feed: What? No.

I’d missed the rest. I’d thought it was better to shut down my tap on the room’s comm access and get out of there.)

Target Two whispered something, which FacilitySys rendered as “What are you?”

I said, “I’m a Shut Up or Get Your Head Smashed.”

So that was two sentences I’d needed.

I had to get out there because Target Leader had started to walk toward Thiago and avoiding a hostage situation was important to my risk assessment module’s Projected Schedule of Events Leading to a Successful Resolution. (In company terms that’s a PSELSR, which is a terrible anagram.) (I don’t mean anagram, I mean the other thing.)

Thiago backed away, saying, “You don’t want to do this. You really don’t want to do this.”

Yeah, well, it was a little too late for them to run away.

I stepped to the outside hatch and told my drones to get into position. Two of the hostiles had helmets and body armor, and one had a helmet but the face shield had been removed. I hit the hatch release and gave the order.

(At the last second, I changed the drones’ instructions from head or face kill-hits to disabling wound-hits in exposed patches on arms and hands, even though it was the hostiles’ own stupid, stupid fault for attacking us. Thinking of Arada’s sad face made me too uncomfortable.)

The stupid hatch (I hate this boat) was slow and all six targets had turned toward me by the time it opened. My drones struck just as I dove out onto the deck. I hit one target with an energy burst from my right arm, kneecapped the second, two dropped from drone strikes and the last one went down flailing, hand closing convulsively on his weapon’s trigger and shooting me right in the chest. For fuck’s sake.

By that time, Target Leader had Thiago’s arm, weapon pointed at Thiago’s head.

I sacrificed six more drones to turn the weapons scattered around me into useless heaps of metal, then shoved to my feet. I walked up the boarding ramp onto our observation deck. I said, “Let him go.” I didn’t really feel like negotiating. I have a module on it, somewhere in my archive. It was never much help.

Target Leader’s eyes had a lot of white showing, and he was exhibiting multiple signs of stress. So was Thiago. A drone view showed me what I looked like, water dripping from my clothes, my jacket with the Preservation survey logo and shirt showing projectile weapon holes, stained with fluid and a little blood.

I circled them as if heading for the hatch. Target Leader dragged Thiago around to stay facing me, then yelled, “Stop! Or I’ll kill him!”

He was right, I’d been trying to make him move, setting up a shot. He had stopped with the observatory bubble behind him, not a good angle for me.

“You can still get out of this,” Thiago gasped. “Just let us go. You can take me as a hostage—”

Oh, right, that’ll help. I said, “No hostages.”

“What is that thing?” Target Leader demanded. “What are you? You’re a bot?”

Thiago said, “It’s a security unit. A bot/human construct.”

Target Leader didn’t seem to believe him. “Why does it look like a person?”

I said, “I ask myself that sometimes.”

Over the comm loudspeaker, Dr. Ratthi said, “It is a person!” In the background, I heard Overse whisper, “Ratthi, get off the comm!”

While that was going on, I did a quick search of my archived video and pulled an episode of Valorous Defenders. It’s not a bad show but this is a terrible episode where the characters are attacked by evil SecUnits. (That’s like the opposite of an oxymoron, since in the media, there’s no such thing as a non-evil SecUnit.) (Is there a word for the opposite of an oxymoron?) I grabbed the three-minute sequence where the SecUnits swarm the base and slaughter the helpless refugees. I uploaded it to stupid boat’s porn feed and set it to play on an endless loop. 

I’m fast, so I’d finished by the time Target Leader shook Thiago and said, “Order it to back off.”

Thiago made a noise suspiciously like a derisive snort. “I wish I could! It doesn’t listen to me.”

I listen to you plenty, Thiago.

“Who does it—” Target Leader wisely gave up on that tack. “Listen, whoever controls this thing, I’m taking this one on my ship—”

“I’ve destroyed your engine,” I said. I really should have done that. Well, too late now.

Glaring with fury, Target Leader jerked Thiago and Thiago stumbled and leaned away from him. And I saw the hole blossom in Target Leader’s upper arm, in the scant few centimeters of clothing and skin exposed between the joints of the badly fitting armor.

I lunged forward and grabbed Thiago, slung him aside, then ripped the projectile weapon away from Target Leader. I knocked him lightly in the stomach and chest with the stock and he dropped to the deck.

Arada stepped out of the hatch, the projectile weapon sensibly pointed down even though my scan showed she had already engaged the safety. She said, “Are you all right? Thiago? SecUnit?”

I said earlier that I was trying to set up a shot; I didn’t say whose.

Arada had taken a course in weapons use after the whole thing with GrayCris. I guess having a bunch of murderers chasing you around a planet so they can suppress your research by murdering you would tend to make you more cautious, even if you are a terminal optimist.

On the feed, I said, Dr. Thiago, Dr. Arada, get inside. I grabbed Target Leader and tossed him onto the deck of his boat, where the other targets were crawling around trying to get to their hatch. My scan picked up a power surge in the boat’s weapon system. That’s what happens when you don’t have time to clear your hostile vehicle. I said over the comm, “Overse, now would be good.”

The thing Overse and the others had been doing while all this was going on was preparing our facility for launch. Under my boots, the deck rumbled and vibrated and our outer supports heaved out of the water, sending waves crashing into the boat as we lifted up.

I don’t think the raiders had realized the facility was mobile. The force of displaced water as our drive kicked in shoved the boat sideways, and the raiders lost their targeting lock.

Our outer supports folded in and we lifted further above the surface. The comm loudspeaker broadcast a siren and a translated warning about minimum safe distance and I guess the raiders believed it because their engines revved frantically. I recalled my drones and they shot down toward us to stream in through the hatch. I walked in after them and let the hatch close behind me as the launch protocols started.

I told myself it wasn’t as much of a shit ending to my first time as Survey Security Consultant While Not Pretending to be a Human and/or Faking the Existence of a Human Supervisor as it could have been. Everybody was alive, they had all their sampling and scans done. Our original schedule actually had us leaving in six planetary days, but since we had finished early Arada had moved that up to three planetary days, that’s why most of the facility had already been prepped for launch.

But we’d been lucky, and I hate luck.

Standing in the access corridor I settled my drones, tasking four to stay with me and sending the others to take up various positions around the facility and go dormant. Then I checked the feed for alerts. The team members who weren’t busy piloting the facility up through the atmosphere were yelling at each other on the comm. Arada came down the corridor. She didn’t have her weapon anymore and my safety protocol check showed she’d unloaded and secured it back in the locker. “SecUnit, you need to get to Medical!”

I checked the feed again; still no alerts. “What happened in Medical?”

“You happened, you got shot.”

Oh, right, that. Arada was gesturing at me so I followed her down the corridor to the main ramp. I poked through the hole in my jacket and shirt and upped my pain sensors a little. The projectiles were still in there. (Sometimes they pop out on their own.)

Medical was at the top of the ramp, a small compartment on the same level as the crew lounge area and galley. The quarters, labs, and storage were on the two levels below and the control deck was above. Ratthi was there waiting for us, standing beside the MedSystem. “Are you all right?” he demanded. “You better lie down!”

I didn’t want to bother with it. “No, I’m fine. Just give me the extractor.”

“No, no, you were in the water, you need decontam and an antibiotic screen. When the system is prepped, you lie down.” He pointed emphatically at the narrow platform and pulled one of the emergency kits down from the rack. “Thiago has some scrapes on his neck,” he told us, “but otherwise he’s fine.”

Ratthi went out with the kit. The yelling on the comm had calmed down but I could hear tense voices from the rec room. Preservation-controlled facilities like this don’t have SecSystems recording everything and cameras everywhere because privacy blah blah blah but I could eavesdrop through the comm and my drones. If I wanted to, which I didn’t, not right now.

Arada said, “Ratthi’s right, SecUnit, you should let the system make sure the wounds aren’t contaminated.” She hesitated. “Did I…” She took a sharp breath. I just stood there because I didn’t understand the question yet. She added, “Was there any other way…”

She didn’t finish again but this time I knew what she was asking. “No. If you’d waited any longer, I would have had to try to use a drone. He’ll probably survive, if the others give him medical attention.”

She really hadn’t wanted to shoot anybody, and had told me she had to force herself to learn how to use the weapon. I hadn’t particularly wanted her to learn, either. (Humans have a bad tendency to use weapons unnecessarily and indiscriminately. Of the many times I had been shot, a depressingly large percentage of hits had come from clients who were trying to “help” me.) (Another significant percentage came from clients who had just wanted to shoot something when I happened to be standing there.)

Arada rubbed her eyes and her mouth pulled in at one side. “Are you trying to make me feel better?”

“No.” I actually wasn’t. I lie to humans a lot, but not to Arada, not about this. “I wouldn’t try to make you feel better. You know what I’m like.”

She made a snorting noise, an involuntary expression of amusement. “I do know what you’re like.”

Her expression had turned all melty and sentimental. “No hugging,” I warned her. It was in our contract. “Do you need emotional support? Do you want me to call someone?”

“I’m fine.” She smiled. On the feed, the MedSystem signaled it was ready. “Now you make sure you’re fine, too.”

She stepped out of the compartment and set the privacy filter on the doorway. I stripped off my clothes and dropped them in the decontam bin and got onto the platform. It would run a check for contaminants and pop the projectiles out of my shoulder and chest.

The process only took three minutes, just long enough to finish the scene of Lineages of the Sun I’d had to pause when Thiago had decided to get me shot. The MedSystem tried to cycle into the therapy and post-treatment options and I stopped it and climbed off the platform. The feed told me we had made orbit and were in the process of rendezvous with our baseship. 
 My clothes now smelled like decontam fluid but they were dry and clean. I got dressed and opened the privacy shield.

Thiago stood in the corridor. Oh, joy.

He looked angry and upset, which I could tell, even though I was looking just to the right of his head. He said, “Did you kill those people?”

I’d been angry enough to tear them all into tiny little pieces. The company who had owned me had protocols for these situations that would have required kill-shots, at least for the armed hostiles out on the deck. Plus I’d already been shot once, and the hostiles had been clear about their intent to kill and/or abduct my clients. But the company didn’t own me anymore and the only human here I was answerable to was Arada, and only in limited ways determined by a contract that Pin-Lee had negotiated for me.

But the whole point of hacking my governor module was that no one got to tell me to kill a bunch of humans if I didn’t feel like it. (Or even if I did feel like it.)

I said, “I’ve reported to my contracted supervisor.”

(I know, I know, I could have said no, I didn’t kill anybody. I could have said that even SecUnits under company protocol use minimum force necessary because the company hates paying survivor damage bonds, and also because SecUnits are not rabid murderers unless humans specifically order them to be. I could have said that I had risked his life not using kill-shots on the armed targets because I knew Arada didn’t want me to.)

He pressed his lips together. “I could ask her.”

I said, “You should definitely do that.”

He glared at me and the brown skin on his cheeks showed pronounced signs of a rise in temperature indicating anger, embarrassment, and possibly other emotions. I was pretty sure he was just pissed off, though. Then he hesitated and said, “Look, I—I didn’t mean to get you shot. I’m sorry.”

If you had meant to get me shot, Thiago, we would be having a different conversation. Because I was still mad, I said, “The security protocol all survey members agreed to is available on the facility feed.”

His face did the thing humans do when they’re trying not to show how annoyed they are. (Mission accomplished.) He said, “I made a mistake. But I had no reason to assume those people were hostile.”

I had reason. I could have thrown together a quick excerpt of my Threat Assessment Report of the approaching boat and why it had been 72 percent likely to attack. I could have pointed out that THEY HAD SHOT ME FIRST when for all they knew I was just another unarmed human. But I didn’t have to answer to him. He didn’t like me, I didn’t like him, and that was fine.

It was absolutely fine.

I walked away down the corridor.

HelpMe.file Excerpt 1

(File detached from main narrative.)

 

Since I’d decided to stay (temporarily) on Preservation Station, Dr. Mensah had asked me to go places with her seven times. Six of those times were just relatively short boring meetings on ships in orbit or in dock. The seventh was when she had asked me to go down to the local planet’s surface with her. I don’t like planets but she lured me there by explaining that it was for an Art Festival/Conference/Religious Observation that would include “a lot of” live performances. After checking to find out the definition of “a lot of” was eighty-seven plus, I agreed to go.

Some of the live performances were demonstrations or seminars I wasn’t interested in, but I managed to fit in thirty-two plays and musicals while Mensah was at meetings or doing things with her family members. (I used drones to record the performances that were overlapping or scheduled against each other. They were all being recorded for the local planetary entertainment feed, and the popular ones would be reconfigured as video productions, but I wanted to see all the versions.) One evening a play was interrupted when Mensah tapped my feed and asked me to please come get her.

The request was so abrupt and out of character I replied with the code phrase we had come up with in case she was being held against her will. She said she was just tired. That was even more out of character. I mean, I could see she got tired, she just hated to admit it.

I left a drone to record the rest of the play and slipped out of the theater. It was night and the crowd in the street was beginning to thin out, but the big open pavilion across the plaza where the party was being held was still bright and noisy.

If you had to be in a crowd of humans, the crowds at this festival weren’t bad, since they were the distracted kind where all the humans and augmented humans are talking to each other or on comm or feed or hurrying to get places. The downside was a lot of humans were waving sticks with lighted objects or spark-emitting toys, or tossing colored powders that popped and emitted light. (I have no idea.) But whatever, with all that going on, nobody noticed me.

Plus, it was Preservation and there were no scanning drones, no armed human security, just some on-call human medics with bot assistants and “rangers” who mainly enforced environmental regulations and yelled at humans and augmented humans to get out of the way of the ground vehicles.

In the pavilion, I located Mensah near the edge of the crowd talking to Thiago and Farai, who was one of her marital partners. I stopped next to Mensah and she grabbed my hand.

Right, it’s usually a good idea to warn bot/human constructs who call themselves Murderbot before making grabby hands, except during a security incident when you would expect/need the human you’re trying to extract from lethal circumstances to grab you and hold on. And this read as the latter; like Mensah needed me to save her. So I didn’t react except to shift closer to her.

Thiago was saying, “I don’t know why you can’t just talk to us.” I heard him clearly, since I was looping my ambient audio to lower the level of the music from blaring down to a pleasant background soundtrack level. The glance Thiago threw at me was annoyed, like I had interrupted their conversation. Hey, she called me. I have a job here, I get paid in hard currency cards and everything.

“I told you why,” Mensah said, and she sounded normal, calm and firm. Except that was also how she sounded when humans were trying to kill us, so. I had the whole pavilion covered by my drones, and weapons scan was negative. (Weapons weren’t even permitted on the planet except in designated wilderness areas where hostile fauna was a problem.) Voices were loud, but my filters showed they were still well within the range of happy-intoxicated-interested emotional tones. But Mensah’s grip on my hand told me how tense her arm muscles were. Situation assessment: I have no idea.

Farai said, “Thiago, no. She asks for space, you need to give that to her.” She smiled at me politely. I never know how to react to that. She leaned in to Mensah to kiss her, and said, “We’ll see you at the house.”

Mensah nodded and turned, and I let her tow me out of the pavilion.

We made it outside to the pedestrian plaza and I asked her, “Do you need a medic?” I thought she might be sick. If I was a human and I’d had to be in the pavilion with all those other humans for the past two and a half hours, I’d be sick.

“No,” she told me, still sounding calm and normal. “I’m just tired.”

I sent a feed request to the ground vehicle (which on Preservation was called a “go-cart” for some reason) (some stupid reason) to meet us at the nearest transportation area. The plaza and streets were lit with little floating balloon-lights, and the dirt and temporary paving painted with elaborate designs in light-up paint (fortunately it wasn’t the marker paint that broadcasts on the feed, which would have been a nightmare). As we walked through the crowd, people recognized Mensah and smiled and waved. Mensah smiled and waved back, but didn’t let go of my hand. On the fringe near the transport area, an intoxicated human wandered toward us with a handful of glitter dust but veered off when I made deliberate eye contact. 
 Our vehicle was waiting for us and I handed her in, and climbed into the other seat. I told it to head for the family camp house, which had been erected in a habitation area on the outskirts of the festival site. The vehicle had a limited bot-driver, which would take humans all over the campground and festival site but knew not to go into the designated no-vehicle sections.

It hummed out of the court and into the dark, along the path that led through high grass and scrub trees. Mensah sighed and opened the window. The breeze was still warm and smelled like vegetation, and the guide-lights along the way were low enough not to obscure the starfield. All the humans and augmented humans staying here for the festival made it a heavily populated area, but we were traveling through the section reserved for humans who actually wanted to sleep. The temporary housing (pop-up shelters of all shapes and sizes, camping vehicles, tents and collapsible structures that looked more like art installations) were all mostly dark and quiet. The camp area for humans who had to be loud was on the far side of the grounds with a sound baffle field to deflect the music and crowd noise. She said, “Thank you. I’m sorry I interrupted your evening.”

I recalled my drones except for the one that was recording the play and the detachment I had designated to keep tabs on the family still at the party. (Another detachment was at the camp house, maintaining a perimeter and keeping watch on the two adults and seven children who had gone back earlier.) I wasn’t sure how to react. Mensah wasn’t acting like I had rescued her from certain death, but she wasn’t acting like we were heading back to the habitat after a boring but successful day collecting samples, either. I said, “I recorded the plays. Do you want to see them?”

She perked up. “I never get to see the performances at this thing. Did you get the one— Oh, what was it called? The new historical by Glaw and Ji-min?”

The difference between “calm and normal” and actual normal was measurable enough that I could have made a chart. I just said, “Yes. It’s pretty good.”

Something was bothering her, and it wasn’t just that her family was clearly as weirded out by me as I was by them. They had assumed I would stay in the camp house, which, no. Mensah had told them I didn’t need any help or supervision and could find my own way around. (Quote: “If it can infiltrate high-security corporate installations while people are shooting at it, it can certainly handle a domestic festival.”)

It wasn’t that her family was phobic about the scary rogue SecUnits the entertainment media and the newsfeeds were so fond of, or that they didn’t like bots. (There were “free” bots wandering around on Preservation, though they had guardians who were technically supposed to keep track of them.) It was just me-the-SecUnit they didn’t like.

(That didn’t apply to the seven kids. I was illicitly trading downloads via the feed with three of them.)

I think if I had been a normal bot, or even like a normal SecUnit, just off inventory, naive and not knowing anything about how to get along in the human world or whatever, like the way humans would write it for the media, basically, it would have been okay. But I wasn’t like that. I was me, Murderbot.

So instead of Mensah having a pet bot like poor Miki, or a sad bot/human construct that needed someone to help it, she had me.

(I told this to Dr. Bharadwaj later, because we talked about a lot of things while she was doing research about bot/human relations for her documentary. After thinking about it, she said, “I wish I thought you were wrong.”)

(Farai was a possible exception. Up on the station, when Mensah had first introduced me to her family, she’d had a conversation with me. Or a conversation at me, you could say. Transcript:

Farai: “You know we’re grateful for how you returned her to us.”

I did know, I guess. What do humans say in this situation? A quick archive search came up with some variation on “okay, um” and even I knew that wasn’t going to cut it.

(Just a heads-up, when a murderbot stands there looking to the left of your head to avoid eye contact, it’s probably not thinking about killing you, it’s probably frantically trying to come up with a reply to whatever you just said to it.)

She added, “I wanted to ask what your relationship to her is.”

Uh. In the Corporation Rim, Mensah was my owner. On Preservation, she was my guardian. (That’s like an owner, but Preservation law requires they be nice to you.) But Mensah and Pin-Lee were trying to get my status listed as “refugee working as employee/security consultant.”

But I knew Farai knew all that, and I knew she was asking for an answer that was closer to objective reality. And wow, I did not have that answer. I said, “I’m her SecUnit.” (Yes, that’s still in the buffer.)

She lifted her brows. “And that means?”

Backed into yet another conversational corner, I fell back on honesty. “I don’t know. I wish I knew.”

She smiled. “Thank you.”

(And that was that.)

Mensah’s family were also weirded out by the idea that I would be providing security, and were afraid I would be, I don’t know, scaring legitimate visitors and killing people, I guess. And granted, while I have been a key factor in certain clusterfucks of gigantic proportions and my risk assessment module has serious issues, my threat assessment record is pretty great, like 93 percent. (Most of the negative points came from that time I didn’t know that Wilken and Gerth were hired killers until Wilken tried to shoot Don Abene in the head, but that was an outlier.)

Mensah’s family also thought they didn’t need security, which, maybe before GrayCris, that had been true. But as it was, during the festival I only had to deal with five incursions, four by outsystem newsfeed journalists with recording drones. I took control of the drones (I can always use a few more) and notified the local Rangers who drove off the human journalists. The fifth incursion was the one that got me in trouble with Amena, Mensah’s oldest offspring.

Since the festival had started, I had been taking note of a potential hostile that Amena had been associating with. Evidence was mounting up and my threat assessment was nearing critical. Things like: (1) he had informed her that his age was comparable to hers, which was just below the local standard for legal adult, but my physical scan and public record search indicated that he was approximately twelve Preservation standard calendar years older, (2) he never approached her when any family members or verified friends were with her, (3) he stared at her secondary sexual characteristics when her attention was elsewhere, (4) he encouraged her to take intoxicants that he wasn’t ingesting himself, (5) her parental and other related humans all assumed she was with her friends when she was seeing him and her friends all assumed she was with family and she hadn’t told either group about him, (6) I just had a bad feeling about the little shit.

You might think the obvious thing to do was to notify Mensah or Farai or Tano, the third marital partner. I didn’t.

If there was one thing I understood, it was the difference between proprietary and non-proprietary data.

So, on the night when Potential Target invited Amena to come back to his semi-isolated camp house with him to “meet some friends,” I decided to come along.

He led her into the darkened house, and she stumbled on a low table. She giggled and he laughed. Sounding way more intoxicated than he actually was, he said, “Wait, I got it,” and tapped the house’s feed to turn on the lights. 

And I was standing in the middle of the room.

He screamed. (Yes, it was hilarious.)

Amena clapped a hand over her mouth, startled, then recognized me. She said, “What the hell? What are you doing here?”

Potential Target gasped, “What—Who—?”

Amena was furious. “That’s my second mother’s … friend,” she said through gritted teeth. “And her security … person.”

“What?” He was confused, then the word “security” penetrated. He stepped away from her. “Uh … I guess … You’d better go.”

Amena looked at him, and then glared at me, then turned and stamped out the door and down the steps to the path. I followed her, and he backed away as I passed him. Yeah, you better.

On the dirt path, lit by the low floating guide-lights, I caught up with her. (Not so much intentionally, but my legs were longer and she was putting more energy into stamping her feet than gaining distance.)

She said, “How did you know where I was? What were you doing, hiding under the porch?”

She thought I wouldn’t get the domestic animal reference. I said, “Wow, that was rude. Especially considering that I’m your second mother’s”—I made ironic quote marks—“‘friend.’ Is that how you talk to your bot-servants?”

My drone cam showed her expression turn startled and then a combination of sulky and guilty. “No. I don’t have bot-servants! I didn’t know—I never heard you talk.”

“You didn’t ask.” Had I not been talking? I had been talking to the kids on the feed, and to Mensah. Maybe with the rest of the family it had been easier to pretend to be a robot again. I added, “No one else approached that house. He lied about meeting other humans there.”

She stamped along in silence for twelve point five seconds. “Look, I’m sorry, but I’m not some kind of idiot, and I don’t fuck around. If he’d done anything I didn’t like, I was going to leave. And if he wouldn’t let me leave, I have the feed, I can call for help whenever I want.” She was scornful, and way overconfident. “I wasn’t going to let him hurt me.”

I said, “If I thought he was going to hurt you, I’d be disposing of his body. I don’t fuck around, either.”

She stopped and stared up at me. I stopped but kept my gaze on the path ahead. I said, “Mensah is a planetary leader of a minor political entity that has managed to get the angry attention of major corporates. Her situation has changed. Your situation has changed. You need to grow up and deal with it.”

She took a breath to say something, stopped, then shook her head. “He wasn’t a corporate spy. He was just someone…”

“Someone you don’t know who showed up out of nowhere at a massive public festival attended by half the continent and whatever offworld humans happen to be wandering through.” I knew he wasn’t a corporate spy (see above, disposing of bodies) but she sure didn’t.

She was quiet for sixteen seconds. “Are you going to tell my parents about this?”

Is that what she was worried about? I was insulted and exasperated. “I don’t know. I guess you’ll find out.”

She stamped away.

So, in retrospect, I could see that hadn’t gone so well.

Our vehicle rumbled through the dark, up the low hill to the camp house, which was a pop-up two-story structure with broad covered balconies off both levels. It had been placed near a couple of large trees with frilly leaves that curved over the roof. It had been built by Mensah’s grandfather, while her grandmothers and other assorted family members had been working on the original planetary survey and terraforming. The colonists who hadn’t been living in orbit on their ship had all stayed in temporary structures at that point, that were moved seasonally to avoid destructive weather patterns in the parts of the planet that had been habitable at that time.

There were other pop-ups, large and small, planted all over the hills around us, the nearest twenty-seven meters away. Lights were on inside the house and one light floated above the beacon spot for the vehicles. I would have worried about the lack of lighting if I hadn’t had thirty-seven drones on patrol in the immediate area.

(Drones had picked up previously identified humans and augmented humans returning to the other houses or passing through the area, and I’d conducted safety checks on unidentified humans encountered for the first time. I was cataloguing power signatures on some small mobility devices used by non-augmented humans for medical reasons; I hadn’t seen these anywhere in the Corporation Rim, though maybe that was because I hadn’t spent much time hanging out on planets with human populations not exclusively engaged in corporate slave labor. (The entertainment media showed planets that weren’t all corporate slave labor, I had just never been on one.)) (The drones had also tracked the five younger kids on a completely illicit expedition to a nearby creek where they had performed some kind of ritual that involved jumping out at each other from behind bushes and rocks. They returned to the house without being caught by the adult humans or older siblings and were now collapsed in their upstairs bunk room, watching media.)

(The house actually had secure sealable window and door hatches, WHICH NO ONE USED, but at least this made it easy for my patrol drones.)

As the vehicle settled into its spot, Mensah said, “I’m just going to sit outside for a bit. Why don’t you go on back to the festival? There’s a few more plays tonight, aren’t there?”

I try to avoid asking humans if there’s anything wrong with them. (Mostly because I don’t care.) (On the rare occasions where I did care, it would have meant starting a conversation not directly related to security protocol, and that was just a slippery slope waiting to happen, for a variety of reasons.) But humans asked each other about their current status all the time, so how hard could it be? It was a request for information, that was all. I did a quick search and pulled up a few examples from my media collection. None of the samples seemed like anything I’d ever voluntarily say, so before I could change my mind I went with, “What’s wrong?”

She was surprised, then gave me a sideways look. “Don’t you start.”

So there was something wrong and even the other humans had noticed. I said, “I have to know about any potential problems for an accurate threat assessment.”

She lifted a brow and opened the vehicle door. “You never mentioned that on our survey contract.”

I got out of the vehicle and followed her toward a group of chairs next to the house, scattered around in the grass under the trees. The shadow was deep so I had to switch to a dark filter to see her. “That was because I was half-assing my job.”

She took a seat. “If that was you half-assing your job, I don’t want to see what you’re like when…” The smile faded and she trailed off, then added, “But I suppose I did see you when you were doing your best.”

I sat down, too. (Sitting down with a human like this would never not feel strange.) Her expression wasn’t upset, but it wasn’t not upset, either. But I could tell my smartass comment had taken us down an awkward conversational avenue where I hadn’t wanted to go. I wished I was ART, who was good at this kind of thing. (The thing being getting you to talk about what it wanted you to talk about but also making you think about what it wanted you to talk about in different ways.) (I wasn’t kidding when I said ART was an asshole.) “You didn’t answer the question.” 

She settled back in her chair. “You sound worried.”

“I am worried.” I could feel my face making the expression whether I wanted it to or not.

She let her breath out. “It’s nothing. I’ve been having nightmares. About being held prisoner on TranRollinHyfa, and … you know.” She made an impatient gesture. “It’s completely normal. It would be odd if I wasn’t having nightmares.”

I hadn’t seen much of the recovery phase of trauma (my job was to get the client to the MedSystem before they died; it took care of all the messy aftermath, including the retrieved client protocol) but in the shows I watched, recovery was featured a lot. There was a trauma recovery program that Bharadwaj had used in the Station Medical Center, and the big hospital in the port city had one, too.

I wasn’t the only one who thought Mensah should go get the trauma treatment. I was probably the only one who knew she hadn’t. (She hadn’t exactly lied; it was more a way of letting the other humans assume she had.) But the treatment wasn’t like a one-time thing with a MedSystem; it took multiple long visits, and I knew she had never made time for it in her schedule. I said, “Is that why you’re afraid to go off-station without me?”

So there were two positions on whether the Preservation Planetary leader needed security. The first was the one 99 percent of the population shared, that she did not unless she went on a formal visit to somewhere like the Corporation Rim. And to a large extent, they were right.

The crime stats on Preservation Station and the planet were pitifully low, and usually involved intoxication-related property damage or disturbances and/or minor infractions of station cargo handling or planetary environmental regulations. Mensah had never needed on-station or on-planet security before this, except for the young Preservation Council–trainee humans who followed her around and kept track of her appointments and handed her things occasionally. (And they did not count as security.)

The other 1 percent was composed of me, Mensah’s survey team, all the humans working in Station Security, and the members of the Preservation Council who had seen the GrayCris assassins try to kill her. But that incident had been kept out of the newsfeeds, so hardly anyone thought Mensah needed a security consultant let alone a SecUnit.

But GrayCris was not doing so hot now due to their hired security service Palisade making an extremely bad decision to punch my ex-owner bond company in the operating funds by attacking one of its gunships. (The company is paranoid and greedy and cheap but also ruthless, methodical, and intensely violent when it thinks it’s being threatened.) Relations between the two corporates had deteriorated since what we call The Gunship Incident, with GrayCris assets getting mysteriously destroyed a lot in supposedly random accidents and its executives and employees getting blown up or found stuffed in containers way too small for intact adult humans and so on.

And once GrayCris had started to cease to exist, even my threat assessment had dropped drastically, but Mensah had still wanted me to continue to provide security. I thought she was humoring me, and taking the opportunity to pay me in hard currency cards which I would need if/when I left Preservation, and giving me practice in being around humans in a setting where I was not categorized as a tool and/or deadly weapon. (Yeah, I assumed it was about me, but humans assume everything is about them, too. It’s not an uncommon problem, okay?)

But for a while now I had been thinking it was about something else.

Her mouth twisted a little and she looked away, over the dark hills and fields toward the lighted windows of the other camp houses and tents. She said, “I suppose it was obvious.”

I said, “Not obvious.” Not to most of the humans, anyway. I had a feeling that Farai and Tano knew, but weren’t sure what to do about it.

She shrugged a little. “It’s hardly surprising that I feel safer with you. It’s also easier to be around people who understand what happened, what it’s like to be in that situation. That’s you and the rest of the survey team.” She hesitated. “Farai and Tano understand, but I haven’t explained to my brother and sister and Thiago and the others why I can’t just rely on them for emotional support about this, as usual.” Her face turned grim. “They don’t understand what it’s like to be under corporate authority.”

That I got. Humans in the Preservation Alliance didn’t have to sign up for contract labor and get shipped off to mines or whatever for 80 to 90 percent of their lifespans. There was some strange system where they all got their food and shelter and education and medical for free, no matter what job they did. It had something to do with the giant colony ship that had brought them here, and a promise by the original crew to take care of everyone in perpetuity if they would just get on the damn thing and not die in the old colony. (It was complicated and when I watched their historical dramas, I tended to fast forward through the economics parts.) Whatever, the humans seemed to like it.

But she was right, these humans had no concept of what it was like to live under corporate authority. And they really didn’t know what it was like to be the target of a corporate entity that wanted to kill you.

I replayed my recording of Mensah talking to Thiago and Farai at the party. Mensah had been abducted from Port FreeCommerce at a meeting for the relatives of the murdered survey members. Maybe the noisy party, where the other humans who would normally help her had been distracted, had just started to feel too similar.

I said, “You need to get the trauma treatment.”

Her voice sharpened. “I will. But I have some things to finish first.” She turned toward me. “And I want you to go on that survey mission with Arada. They need you. And it’s a wonderful opportunity for you.”

It was too dark for her to see my expression. I’m not sure what it was but you could probably describe it as “skeptical.” (Ratthi says that’s how I look most of the time.)

With that confident planetary leader I am totally convincing you of this tone, she added, “And you know Amena and Thiago are going, too. I’ll feel better if you’re there to keep an eye on them.”

Uh-huh. “What about you?”

She took a breath to say she’d be fine. I knew her well enough to know those exact words were about to come out. But then she hesitated. The drone I had watching her face increased magnification, its low-light filter rendering her features in black and white. Her expression was intense and fierce and she was biting her lower lip. She said, “I hate feeling so weak. I just need to stop. And I need to stop leaning on you. It’s not fair to you. We need to be apart so I can … stand on my own feet again.”

I didn’t think she was wrong, but I still wasn’t used to things that were unfair to me being a major point of consideration for humans. It also sounded vaguely like the break-up part of the romance scenes on the shows I watched, most of which I usually skimmed over. I said, “It’s not me, it’s you.”

She huffed a laugh.

And then I sort of blackmailed her.

Part of my problem now was that Mensah, who was way too honest about this kind of thing, had later told Amena that she had asked me to keep an eye on her, which Amena interpreted in some hormone-related human way I’m not sure I understood. Thiago, who is not an adolescent and has no excuse, interpreted it as Mensah not trusting him to take care of his niece. 

Amena is on the survey because her education requires an internship in almost getting killed, I guess. Due to our previous interaction, she really didn’t want me specifically tasked to watch her.

(Possibly I had been too emphatic with her about Potential Target. After spending my entire existence having to gently suggest to humans that they not do things that would probably get them killed, it was nice to be able to tell them in so many words to not be so fucking stupid. But I didn’t regret doing it.)

An attempt by Amena to go around Mensah and appeal to Farai and Tano had failed spectacularly, in a three-way comm call that became a four-way when Farai had called Mensah to join in on the discussion. (I’m not sure what happened past that point. Even I hadn’t wanted to watch it.)
So that was what had happened before the survey. Now we’re here, ready for the next major disaster. (Spoiler warning.)
We docked with our baseship with no problems, and Arada and the others transferred control to the baseship crew. (The facility wasn’t wormhole capable and was basically just a big, awkward lab module that could land and take off under its own power.)

It was only four standard Preservation day-cycles back to Preservation via wormhole, and I meant to use the time to finish watching Lineages of the Sun. It was a long-running historical family drama, set in an early colony world, with one hundred and thirty-six characters and almost as many storylines.

I’d watched family dramas before, but I’d never spent much time around human families before coming to Preservation. (Data suggests family dramas bear a less than 10 percent resemblance to actual human families, which is unsurprising and also a relief, considering all the murders. In the dramas, not Mensah’s family.)

When the company owned me and rented me out for surveys, my security protocol included datamining, which meant monitoring and recording the humans every second for the duration of the contract, which was excruciating in a lot of ways. Pretty much all the ways. (All the ways involving bodily fluids, and inane conversations.) It would never stop being novel to be around a bunch of humans in a relatively confined space and be able to close a door between me and them and not have to care what they were doing.

Which didn’t mean the humans left me alone.

Ratthi came to my cabin. I didn’t have to let him in, so I did. (I know, I was still getting used to the idea of not minding the fact that a human wanted to talk to me.) He sat on the folding seat opposite my bunk and said, “Thiago will come around, you’ll see. He just doesn’t…”

Ratthi was reluctant to finish the sentence, so I did. “… trust me.”

Ratthi sighed. “It’s all the corporate propaganda about SecUnits being dangerous. He doesn’t know you. He doesn’t know what you’re really like.”

This would be annoying, if Ratthi didn’t genuinely believe it. He’s never seen me kill anyone close up and I’d like to keep it that way.

“And he didn’t know why it was so important that Mensah be protected on station.” He waved a hand at me though I hadn’t said anything. “I know, the more people who knew, the more chance of the newsfeeds finding out. And there was nothing else we could have done, really.”

After Ratthi left, Overse came. When I told the door to open, she just stuck her head in and said, “I don’t want to interrupt, I just wanted to thank you. This is Arada’s first time as a survey lead, and you’ve been really supportive and I know that’s made a difference, and helped her confidence.”

I had no idea how to react to that since I wasn’t sure what being supportive entailed. My job wasn’t to make the humans obey Arada, that wasn’t how Preservation worked. Besides, that hadn’t been a problem. The survey team was grumbly occasionally, but everybody had done their job to a reasonable level. The chance of a mutiny was so low it was registering as a negative number. I’m not sure the word “mutiny” could even apply to any situation that might occur with this survey team; most of them had to be begged to complete the required self-defense certification before we left. And this was what Preservation called an academic survey, where the data collected was going into a public database. (If the planet had been in the Corporation Rim, it would be open to exploitation, but out here nobody wanted it for anything.) I defaulted to, “Arada contracted with me.”

“Yes, and we both know that you’re very capable of making it clear when you think someone doesn’t know what they’re doing.” She smiled at the drone I was using to watch her. “That’s all.”

She left and I replayed the conversation a couple of times.

I trusted Arada’s judgment to a certain extent. She and Overse had always been firmly in the “least likely to abandon a SecUnit to a lonely horrible fate” category, which was always the category I was most interested in. They were my clients, that was all. Like Mensah, like Ratthi and Pin-Lee and Bharadwaj and Volescu (who had opted to retire from active survey work, which gave him the award for most sensible human) and yes, even Gurathin. Just clients. And if anyone or anything tried to hurt them, I would rip its intestines out.

When we came through the wormhole into Preservation space, I was watching episodes of The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon again, since there wasn’t time to start anything new before we reached the station. (Being interrupted isn’t nearly as annoying when I already know the story.) I was worried about Mensah, if everything had been okay while I was gone. I wasn’t sure exactly what “okay” would involve, but I was willing to settle for “unmurdered.”

I was just finishing a rewatch of episode 137 when the ship’s alarm sounded through the comm and feed.

It might just be a navigation anomaly, like another transport in the wrong place. We were in a commonly used approach lane and Preservation tended to be visited by lots of non-corporate transports with no bot pilots who wandered all over the place trying to figure out where the hell they were, or at least that was how I interpreted the constant litany of complaint from Preservation Station Port Authority that Mensah had involuntary access to. With no bot pilot on our baseship, I couldn’t get direct system updates, but I tapped the comm system to let me listen in on the bridge. Transcript:

Copilot Mihail: “It came out of nowhere! Nothing on comm.”

Specialist Rajpreet: “That’s a docking approach. I’m reading active weapons.”

Pilot Roa: “That’s it, raise the Station and tell them—”

Mihail again: “Copy, but there’s no responders near us—”

Well, shit. I rolled out of the bunk and pinged the team feed, and sent to Arada: Dr. Arada, we’re being approached by a potentially hostile vessel. A boarding attempt may be imminent.

A potentially— Oh no! Arada responded.

Again? Overse asked.

I let them deal with the other team queries coming in as I opened my code-sealed locker. I pulled out the projectile weapon, checked the load and charge, then woke my dormant drones. They all activated their cameras at once and I had to take a few seconds to sort and process the multiple inputs.

I’d changed out of the survey uniform before we’d entered the wormhole and back into the clothes I liked (human work boots, pants with lots of pockets (good for storing my small intel drones), T-shirt, and soft hooded jacket, all dark colors) because I didn’t like logos, even the Preservation survey logo, which was just a variation on the planetary seal, and not a corporate logo. I had a deflection vest from Station Security Operations designed to provide some protection from inert blades, slow projectiles, fire, acidic gas, low energy pulses, and so on. I hadn’t been wearing it because it was a) worthless for the kind of firepower usually deployed against me and b) it had a logo on it. (I know, I need to get over that.) 

I made myself put it on under my jacket. I might need all the help I could get.

By this point the Potential Hostile had continued to approach. Pilot Roa was now making a general announcement which was pretty much the same thing I’d already told Arada. As I left the cabin, my drones converged on me in a cloud formation. I needed more direct info from the baseship so I sent one ahead, and it whizzed past me as I started down the corridor toward the access. I had a plan, but it was mostly “keep the hostiles off the ship,” which is not so much a plan as a statement of hopeful intent.

This could be really bad.

I know, I know, I’m Security, I should already have a plan in place for a boarding action. But I was used to having a human supervisor come up with the plans and … Okay, right, I just hadn’t bothered because the chances of an attack while en route to and from the mission site were so slight it wasn’t worth taking the time off from viewing media. I’d put all the work into coming up with attack and defense scenarios for the facility while on planet. (None of which I got to use during the one actual attack on the facility, but though it was tempting, “advance planning sucks” seems to be the wrong lesson to take from that whole incident.)

Anyway, SecUnits were shipped as cargo on company transports and I didn’t even have any old procedure documents for ship-based actions in my archive. The only ship-to-ship attack I’d participated in had been viral, and I’d almost destroyed my brain during it.

Speaking of which, my alert monitors on comm and feed weren’t picking up any attempts by the hostile to make contact. That might just mean they already knew there was no bot pilot to attack with killware or malware.

I went up the ramp past the crew lounge toward the control deck. My drone had zipped ahead up into the baseship and through the passage to its bridge. When the bridge hatch opened to let Rajpreet out, it slipped in. Now I had a camera view of the sensor display surfaces floating above the control boards. Mihail sat in a station chair, sweat plastering their light hair to their forehead. Roa was on his feet pacing, dark brow furrowed in thought, one hand pressed to his feed interface. It looked like a clip from an action series, right before something drastic happened.

Then something drastic happened.

The hit wasn’t at all like the way they show ship combat in the media. I felt something more like a power surge than anything else. Gravity fluctuated just enough to thump me against the bulkhead and the ramp lights flickered. A flood of automated warnings came from the facility engineering pod and then the feed and comm cut out. I scrambled to pick up the baseship’s feed, then gravity fluctuated again as the facility’s drive went offline and we switched to reserve power for life support. My drones scattered as the gravity flux interfered with their propulsion, then pulled back into formation.

On the baseship bridge, my drone watched as Roa and Mihail froze, like a scene on pause. Then Roa said, “That was an impact.”

Mihail’s voice was hoarse as they cycled through displays. “On the facility’s drive housing. A locator missile. Attacker must have fired it when they spotted us leaving the wormhole.”

Oh, shit. Seriously: oh, shit.

My organic parts had a reaction that reminded me how lucky I was not to have a digestive system. We didn’t blow up in the next ten seconds so I pushed off from the bulkhead and kept going toward the facility control deck.

I stepped through the hatch. It was a small hub-shaped control area, with the stations for attaching lab modules and everything else the facility needed to do when it was sitting on a planet. Overse was in the pilot suite though right now the baseship had control. Ratthi was hanging on to the back of the comm chair. Both looked frantic. From the flashing displays, frantic was the right reaction.

“I can’t reach Roa on the comm or feed,” Ratthi was saying.

“It’s all down,” Overse reported. “Arada—” she began, and then grimaced as she remembered there was no feed, no one outside the compartment could hear her. “Damn it!”

I told my drone in the cockpit to establish a connection between Overse’s and Arada’s interfaces and the baseship’s feed. I said aloud and on the feed, Baseship, I’ve reestablished a temporary connection to the interfaces on the facility control deck.

Roa replied, What, SecUnit? Can Arada hear me?

She’s not— Overse began, then Arada swung through the hatch on the far side of the control deck. Overse’s face twisted with relief and she bit her lip hard, then added, Here she is.

I hear you, Roa, Arada said, her mental voice hurried but calm. She reached to squeeze Overse’s shoulder, and nodded to Ratthi and me. Can we tell where the attacker means to board?

The words “means to board” made something uncomfortable happen to my organic parts again. Maybe similar to what Ratthi, who had just made a little “urk” noise, felt.

This would have all been a lot easier if I wasn’t so worried about the stupid humans.

Roa’s voice stayed calm but my baseship bridge drone saw his expression as he said, Looks like they’re heading for the lower level facility hatch, the lab level. I’ve sent Rajpreet down there.

Ratthi and Overse exchanged horrified expressions. Arada set her jaw and told Roa, Understood.

She looked up at me. “SecUnit, could you please…?”

I said, “On my way.”

I ducked back out to the corridor, telling one of my drones to stay in the control deck as a relay. The center foyer was just around the curve, and above it the gravity well access to the baseship. Safety protocols had engaged an air barrier, which allowed solid objects (like humans and SecUnits) to pass through but blocked air flow, so the atmosphere couldn’t rush out if a seal breached.

Leading down from it was a second gravity well that had ladders and a set of stairs for use when the facility was sitting on a planet. Without fluctuating power to worry about, I could have just stepped in and floated down to the lowest facility level, but getting smashed to pieces against a bulkhead wouldn’t be handy just now so I swung down the ladders instead.

Ozone and smoke that the scrubbers couldn’t handle hung in the air and the lights fluctuated. Via my control deck drone, I saw Arada tell Ratthi, “With the feed and comm down we’re going to need a head count to make sure everyone’s accounted for after that hit.”

“Right, right, I’m on it!” Ratthi hurried out the hatch toward the living quarters.

From the bottom of the well I took the central ramp around and came out into the junction for the lower lab level hatch. The smoke here was thick enough for me to pick it up on visual. Specialist Rajpreet was already there, having climbed all the way down the gravity well from the baseship. She had a sidearm—there were a couple in the bridge emergency kit—ready to defend the hatch from a boarding attempt.

It’s always nice when a human looks relieved to see you.

Her voice was mostly steady when she said, “I don’t think we have much time.” I used one of my drones to add her to my feed relay, and she reported, Roa, Dr. Arada, can you hear me? SecUnit’s here at the lock.

I said, What’s our status?

Arada said, Overse has comm partially active. On cue, the comms emitted a burst of static and Overse’s voice said, “To all facility crew, comm and feed are not responding, please report to the facility crew lounge immediately and wait for further instructions.” 

Roa said, SecUnit, I need to make an announcement, can you relay me through the facility comm?

Sure, I don’t have anything else better to do. I said, Go ahead.

Over the comm, Roa said, “The incoming transport has fired on us and is now making a docking maneuver aimed at the facility’s lower level. Station has dispatched an armed ship and two free merchant transports have broken off station approach and are responding as well, but they’re all eighty-four minutes out at best. SecUnit, can you—” The hesitation was long. “Can you repel a boarding attempt long enough for help to arrive?”

Every human on the baseship and the facility was listening.

It was a tricky question. It came down to how many raiders were violently determined to come aboard and what kind of weapons they had. (That scenario could turn out any way from “we thought this was an easy target, let’s run away” to Rajpreet making a desperate last stand with her sidearm over the pieces of what was left of my body.) If they sent an EVAC-suited boarding party down the outside of the hull and came in through one of the hatches in the baseship as well as this one— But that wasn’t what my clients needed to hear right now.

On comm, I said, “Yes.”

Rajpreet’s throat moved as she swallowed, and she muted her feed. She said aloud, “Just tell me what you need me to do.”

I would definitely do that, as soon as I knew. Assuming worse-case scenario (and coincidentally getting her out of my way so I didn’t have to worry about saving a human while I was trying to kill/maim/discourage a bunch of other humans), it was best for her to take up a guard position at the entrance to the gravity well, to at least buy the baseship some time. I was about to tell her to do that.

A jolt vibrated through the deck and a sudden uncompensated surge of acceleration knocked Rajpreet flat. I hit the bulkhead and slid down as my drones scattered. The lights fluctuated again and the life support cut out, then back in.

Oh, this is not good. My plan (make that “plan”) depended on holding the intruders back until the armed station responder or the angry raider-hating merchants got close enough to scare them off. But my bridge drone was reading displays that indicated the hostile had grabbed the facility with the tractors transports use to attach and detach modules. It was pulling us close, intending to clamp us onto its hull and drag us into the wormhole with it. From their frantic cursing, Roa and Mihail agreed.

I got upright and caught Rajpreet’s flailing arm to help her stand. The facility’s comm came back online with a static-obscured warning alarm. Yes, great, that’s really helpful right now.

A survey member, Adjat, staggered into the foyer from the corridor that led to the facility’s lowest storage and lab space. Rajpreet told them, “Get up to crew level, hurry!”

Adjat nodded, heading for the corridor. “Hatches are jammed to labs 3 and 4, I don’t know if anyone’s trapped—”

“They’re doing a headcount up there,” Rajpreet said, pushing them on toward the access.

I had an idea, though it had its downside. On the feed, I said, Roa, can the baseship jettison the facility?

The baseship itself was just a small carrier, with bridge, drives, and living space for the five-person crew. Most of its bulk was designed to be able to grab or deploy the facility module.

Mihail replied, calm but breathless, He’s working on it, checking sensor view to see if our clamps are clear—

So they had already thought of it. It was nice working with smart humans. Now if I could just keep them all alive.

A lot of my attention was on the hatch two meters away from me. I was scanning for any attempt to breach it, either physically or via the hostile’s feed. I tried a breach of my own through the feed, but the hostile’s wall was so solid I couldn’t get any kind of read off it.

On my feed relay, Arada said, We can remote-jettison from here—the facility command center—if you transfer control. But we need to get the rest of the team up to the baseship.

Ratthi added, I’m doing a headcount now, but with the feed and comm not responding—

Roa broke in: Our clamps are clear, we can jettison.

Arada said, Roa, will they be able to scan us? If they can tell we’ve abandoned the facility—

Roa replied, They may be able to.

They would definitely be able to. Before anybody else could butt in, I said, They may fire on the baseship once the facility is jettisoned.

That was the downside I mentioned. It just depended on how anxious the hostile was to get to the wormhole with the facility before the responder and merchants arrived, whether they were ordinary assholes or huge assholes, if they wanted the facility or the humans in the facility, if they were afraid of retaliation by Preservation or just didn’t care.

The survey team members still trying to talk on the relay feed all shut up.

Roa said, Yes, that’s … Yes. Dr. Arada, we don’t have a lot of time, do we evacuate and jettison or—?

Still sounding calm, Arada said, SecUnit, do you agree we should jettison?

Oh right, I was the security team head.

If I/we were wrong about this, the hostile would fire on the helpless baseship and we would all die. If we stayed with the facility, there might be a chance for rescue. If the hostiles didn’t drag us into the wormhole, overwhelm me, and kill all the humans or do other terrible things to them.

The cheap education modules the company gives SecUnits had never mentioned this kind of dilemma, so I didn’t have anything strategic to go on.

Ugh, self-determination sucks sometimes.

I reminded myself I had always wanted humans to listen to my advice. I said, Jettison.

Arada said, We jettison. Ratthi, confirm head count and send everyone up to the baseship. She sounded calm and certain. Much more so than Roa.

“Attacker is still pulling us toward the wormhole,” Mihail announced on comm, not sounding too much like someone who was restraining the urge to scream a little.

On the relay, I heard Ratthi yelling at people to get moving and I got sporadic drone views of survey team members hurrying into the gravity well.

Roa took a breath. “Facility control, prepare for separation.”

Overse announced, “Facility module will seal in two minutes and counting.”

Drone audio picked up someone arguing but I had to prioritize Roa and Mihail and Arada, who were all telling different humans to do different things. My bridge drone’s view of the sensor display started to show more interpretable detail. That big wobbly thing was the wormhole. The two blips way off (way way off) in the distance were our potential rescue ships. There was no blip for the hostile because it was too close.

Another vibration traveled through the deck but this one was more familiar. Rajpreet’s gaze was on the hatch display, her eyes wide. She whispered, “They attached to our lock.”

Whispering may have been an irrational impulse, but I could definitely sympathize. I said on the feed relay, Hostile has matched locks.

Overse said, Ratthi, I need a confirmed head count, now. My gravity well drone picked up two stragglers, Remy and Hanifa, scrambling up the ladders to the baseship and Ratthi, for fuck’s sake, coming back down.

I started to tap his feed but I picked up something on audio. It was scraping, vibrating through the outer hatch. Okay, that’s definitely happening. I sent on the feed, Hostile is attempting to breach the hatch, boarding may be imminent. 

Roa said, Rajpreet, SecUnit, get out of there.

I told Rajpreet, “Go, I’ll be behind you.”

Rajpreet backed toward the corridor access. If the hostiles chose this moment to board, before we could seal off and separate, we were screwed.

I heard Ratthi yell, “No, No!” through my drone audio. His voice was harsh with fury, fear. The impulse to run to him made me flinch, but I needed to hold my position. Something had gone wrong up there. On the feed, I said, Dr. Ratthi, report.

Ratthi, of all my humans except Dr. Mensah, listens to me the most carefully. Probably it has something to do with the time he was about to step out of the hopper to retrieve some equipment and if he had, he would have been eaten by giant predatory fauna. Sounding simultaneously frustrated, angry, and terrified, Ratthi said, Amena and Kanti aren’t here. Thiago is looking for them. They aren’t in the quarters or the upper labs, they must be down in the lower level somewhere.

Well, shit.

I had audio and visual of the baseship access through my drones, so I was able to see when it exploded. (No, not physically exploded. Emotionally exploded.) Humans yelling and waving their arms and other unhelpful things.

You know, it’s not like I’m having a good time either right now.

I told Rajpreet, “Get to the gravity well access,” and started down the corridor toward the labs and sample storage, where Adjat had tried to tell Rajpreet about jammed doors. I ordered a drone to stay near the hatch so I would have some warning if anything came through it. I split the rest of the formation, sending two-thirds up the access to take a guard position with Rajpreet and telling the rest to follow me. On the feed, I said, calmly, Acknowledged, I’ll find them. SHIT.

I’d made a stupid mistake. Feed access in the facility was down unless your interface was in range of one of my drones, so the connection could be relayed to the baseship, and the comm was patchy and unreliable. We, me and the humans, were too used to the feed, which made it impossible to lose track of someone, to leave them behind. With an active feed, even if you were unconscious, your interface could be used to track your location.

Arada said over the feed, We’re holding for you, SecUnit.

Get to the baseship, Arada, I sent back.

It was amazing how fast our mostly orderly retreat had turned into a disaster. My drone formation formed around Rajpreet, who was waiting anxiously at the bottom of the gravity well. At the top, baseship crew and survey team members gathered, clutching handweapons they barely knew how to use. I just hoped nobody accidentally shot themselves or anyone else. I tapped my drone relay and saw Arada, Overse, Ratthi, and damn it Thiago waiting at the facility access junction. Arada was talking on the feed to Roa and trying to shove a resisting Overse into the gravity well. I started to tell them—I don’t know what I was going to tell them, but it was going to involve the words “I can’t do my job if none of you fucking listen to me” but then interference blotted out the connection and I lost all my drones in the baseship.

I reached a hatch to lab 3 that was stuck partly open, just a few centimeters from the deck. I hit the floor and directed my scan under the hatch, but I couldn’t pick up any indication of a human body, living or otherwise. But drone audio detected a muffled human voice, coming from farther up the corridor.

I shoved upright and slammed around the curve and oh right, that must be the hatch Adjat had seen. The bulkhead was crumpled along the top of the seal, and the panel with the manual release had been blown in a power surge. The plastic parts were melted and the whole hatch assembly was dripping with fire suppressant foam where the automated emergency system had engaged. The facility’s systems in this area must be down or cut off, and the emergency report had never reached the control deck. My audio picked up a muffled voice from the blocked compartment, but it was too faint for human hearing.

My first impulse was to blow the hatch. Fortunately my second impulse was to grab the manual release and pull. It didn’t give, but I could feel the seal was broken. At least some of the locks that held it shut had been disengaged. Which meant someone had already triggered the manual release inside but something was jammed. I ripped the panel open and found crumpled metal pinning the release mechanism. I shoved my sleeve back, tuned the energy weapon in my right arm down to the lowest setting, and burned through it. The hatch clunked as it released and I dragged it open.

Kanti jolted forward and I caught her. “It wouldn’t open,” she gasped. She clutched the kind of tool used on surveys for chipping rock samples and her hands were bloody. The power inside was out, the only light from the emergency glows along the walls, and equipment and sample cases were jumbled everywhere. Amena was across the compartment, her leg pinned under a lab bench that had collapsed when the bulkhead crumpled. She was conscious and struggling to free herself.

My hatchway drone showed the warning lights blinking around the lock. Yikes. I pulled Kanti out into the corridor and took the tool away from her. “Get to the gravity well, now.” On what was left of the feed I told Rajpreet, I’m sending Kanti to you.

Kanti hesitated, eyes wide and glazed over. Blood trickled down from a cut above her hairline. Behind me, Amena yelled, “Kanti, go!”

Kanti pulled away and ran erratically down the corridor, bouncing off the bulkhead. I ducked into the compartment and went to Amena. Tears streamed down her face, her nose running in that gross “badly upset human” way. She banged on the lab bench. “Here, here, we couldn’t pry it up!”

I felt under it carefully, where the support strut had pinned her leg. There wasn’t blood, though it had to hurt. I felt marks on the metal from the tool Kanti had been clutching. She had had it in the right spot, but didn’t have the leverage needed to pry up the strut. I wedged the tool back in place and leaned on it. My drones met Kanti at the end of the corridor and formed a protective cloud around her as she stagger-ran through the foyer toward the gravity well.

The strut bent back and Amena tried to wriggle out and yelped in pain. I said, “Just take it slow,” and managed to sound like we had all the time we needed. (We did not.) My hatchway drone relayed the rising energy readings from the airlock where something was trying to override the security seal.

In the access tube, Rajpreet had grabbed Kanti and was climbing with her up the gravity well, both surrounded by my cloud of drones. Amena wriggled some more, wincing, then reached for my arm and said, “Just pull really hard!”

I took her arm and tugged and she slid out from under the bench. I stood, pulled her with me, and picked her up in one arm. I’d lost contact with Rajpreet but my drones confirmed she wasn’t in the gravity well anymore. I told Amena, “Hold on,” and ran down the corridor.

I couldn’t make anywhere near my top speed; there was too much debris, the corridor too narrow and curving.

I made it almost to the end of the corridor just as the hatch blew with a loud pop. The smell of melted metal and ozone filled the corridor. My hatch drone sent me a view of hazy smoke and movement inside the lock. Time for a split millisecond decision—could I sprint through the foyer, past the breached hatch, up the ramp to the gravity well, and climb up into the baseship so we could close the hatches and separate before the hostiles stormed inside?

Uh, maybe?

Then my input from the hatch drone dissolved in an abrupt burst of energy. I took a silent step backward, then another, keeping the motion smooth and slow. I started a quick analysis of the drone’s last transmitted intel. On the feed, I sent, Hatch is breached, hostiles onboard, seal and jettison now. 

I didn’t pick up any acknowledgment and couldn’t tell if it went through or not.

Amena was silent, holding herself stiffly immobile against my side, her heart pounding. I eased back around the curve in the corridor, and stepped into the first open hatch. I set her down and mouthed the words “No noise.” She nodded, gripped the hatch’s safety rail to stay upright, and looked up at me with wide eyes. I wanted to use my drones to look at her, but while that was calming for me, it wouldn’t be for her. If I was going to get her out of this alive, keeping her calm and communicating accurately was going to be important. I put my face in an expression that I hoped would convey reassurance, then changed it to intense concentration and stared at the bulkhead. The image analysis finished and I reviewed it. The drone had caught a sensor ghost of something that was emitting energy and floating about two meters above the deck. I included Amena’s interface in my relay and said, Close the hatches, Arada, do it now. They have drones.

Amena caught her breath and bit her lip, but didn’t say anything.

Still no acknowledgment. I didn’t know if they could hear me, if they had already jettisoned, what the hell was going on up there. We had to be close to the wormhole by now.

(It sounds like I was calm, but I had no idea what the hell I was going to do.)

I felt feed static like a drill through the back part of my head, and then Overse saying, SecUnit, SecUnit, can you hear me? We’ve jettisoned the facility from baseship and are in the safepod, about to launch. Can you get to the EVAC suits in the lower secondary lock? The baseship can catch you in their tractor.

I almost said aloud, “Why are they in the fucking safepod and not in the baseship?” but managed not to. Amena watched me with a not reassuring combination of fear and exasperation. The EVAC suit thing … was not a bad idea at all.

Copy, we’ll go for the EVAC suits, I told Overse. If there was an acknowledgment, I didn’t hear it.

I held out an arm and Amena grabbed my jacket. I picked her up and sent half the drones ahead to scout our path. There was no sign of any hostile movement yet.

I stepped out into the corridor and headed away from the main hatch foyer to the junction to the engineering pod. It looked worse than the lab corridor. Lights were down to emergency levels and the deck had buckled.

Fortunately we didn’t have far to go, just straight through the pod. My audio picked up a banging and grinding noise—maybe the intruder’s drones trying to get through a hatch somewhere.

We reached the engineering outer hatch foyer, light from the emergency markers pointing to the EVAC suit locker.

These were a different model than I’d used before, more expensive, where you could step into them and pull them up with an assist from the suit’s own power supply. I set Amena down and she rapidly tied her hair up, then did a one-legged hop into the suit. I ordered my drones to land on me and go dormant, and had my suit on by the time she was fastening her helmet. Something vibrated deep in the deck; was it the safepod launching? My organic parts didn’t feel good about this. If that was the safepod, I think they’d waited too long. Human actions often seem way too slow to me because of my processing speed, but I didn’t think this was one of those times.

The suits also had secure feed connections, so I could check to make sure Amena’s was working and sealed properly, and access its controls. Don’t use your comm, I told her over the secured feed. They could be scanning for any kind of activity and it was easier for me to mask our feed than the comm.

Got it, she replied. Her feed voice was nervous but not panicky. The suit was supporting her injured leg, letting her stand upright. I’m ready.

I told her suit to follow me and opened the airlock.
